As my classmate took a full swing, the\nbat slipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking\nme directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of\nimpact.\nThe bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my\nnose into a distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my\nbrain slamming into the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of\nswelling surged throughout my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a\nbroken nose, multiple skull fractures, and two shattered eye sockets.\nWhen I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running\nover to help. I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes.\nOne of my classmates took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I\nused it to plug the stream of blood rushing from my broken nose.\nShocked and confused, I was unaware of how seriously I had been\ninjured.\nMy teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the\nlong walk to the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back\ninto school. Random hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We\ntook our time and walked slowly. Nobody realized that every minute\nmattered.\nWhen we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of\nquestions.\n“What year is it?”\n“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.\n“Who is the president of the United States?”\n“Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.\n“What is your mom’s name?”\n“Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.\n“Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten\nseconds to remember my own mother’s name.\nThat is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle\nthe rapid swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the\nambulance arrived. Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken\nto the local hospital.\nShortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled\nwith basic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first\nseizure of the day. Then I stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors\nhurried to supply me with oxygen, they also decided the local hospital\nwas unequipped to handle the situation and ordered a helicopter to fly\nme to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.\nI was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the\nhelipad across the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as\none nurse pushed me along while another pumped each breath into me\nby hand. My mother, who had arrived at the hospital a few moments\nbefore, climbed into the helicopter beside me. I remained unconscious\nand unable to breathe on my own as she held my hand during the\nflight.\nWhile my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my father went\nhome to check on my brother and sister and break the news to them.\nHe choked back tears as he explained to my sister that he would miss\nher eighth-grade graduation ceremony that night. After passing my\nsiblings off to family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my\nmother.\nWhen my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of\nnearly twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and\nwheeled me into the trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain\nhad become so severe that I was having repeated post-traumatic\nseizures. My broken bones needed to be fixed, but I was in no\ncondition to undergo surgery. After yet another seizure—my third of\nthe day—I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a\nventilator.\nMy parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier,\nthey had entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister\nwas diagnosed with leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My\nbrother was just six months old. After two and a half years of\nchemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone marrow biopsies, my\nlittle sister finally walked out of the hospital happy, healthy, and\ncancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents found\nthemselves back in the same place with a different child.\nWhile I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social\nworker to comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met\nwith them a decade earlier on the evening they found out my sister had\ncancer.\nAs day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My\nparents slept restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they\nwould collapse from fatigue, the next they would be wide awake with\nworry. My mother would tell me later, “It was one of the worst nights\nI’ve ever had.”\nMY RECOVERY\nMercifully, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the\npoint where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma.\nWhen I finally regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my\nability to smell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniff\nan apple juice box. My sense of smell returned, but—to everyone’s\nsurprise—the act of blowing my nose forced air through the fractures\nin my eye socket and pushed my left eye outward. My eyeball bulged\nout of the socket, held precariously in place by my eyelid and the optic\nnerve attaching my eye to my brain.\nThe ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into\nplace as the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would\ntake. I was scheduled for surgery one week later, which would allow me\nsome additional time to heal. I looked like I had been on the wrong end\nof a boxing match, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I returned\nhome with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a bulging\nleft eye.\nThe following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life\nwas on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn’t see\nstraight. It took more than a month, but my eyeball did eventually\nreturn to its normal location. Between the seizures and my vision\nproblems, it was eight months before I could drive a car again. At\nphysical therapy, I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in a\nstraight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me down, but\nthere were more than a few moments when I felt depressed and\noverwhelmed.\nI became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to\nthe baseball field one year later. Baseball had always been a major part\nof my life. My dad had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis\nCardinals, and I had a dream of playing professionally, too. After\nmonths of rehabilitation, what I wanted more than anything was to get\nback on the field.\nBut my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled\naround, I was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. I\nwas sent down to play with the sophomores on junior varsity. I had\nbeen playing since age four, and for someone who had spent so much\ntime and effort on the sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividly\nremember the day it happened. I sat in my car and cried as I flipped\nthrough the radio, desperately searching for a song that would make\nme feel better.\nAfter a year of self-doubt, I managed to make the varsity team as a\nsenior, but I rarely made it on the field. In total, I played eleven\ninnings of high school varsity baseball, barely more than a single game.\nDespite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I could\nbecome a great player. And I knew that if things were going to\nimprove, I was the one responsible for making it happen. The turning\npoint came two years after my injury, when I began college at Denison\nUniversity. It was a new beginning, and it was the place where I would\ndiscover the surprising power of small habits for the first time.\nHOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS\nAttending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned a\nspot on the baseball team and, although I was at the bottom of the\nroster as a freshman, I was thrilled. Despite the chaos of my high\nschool years, I had managed to become a college athlete.\nI wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I\nfocused on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and\nplayed video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early\neach night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to\nkeep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but\nthey gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident\nagain. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the classroom as I\nimproved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s during my\nfirst year.\nA habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in\nmany cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated\nsmall but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were\nunimaginable to me when I started. For example, for the first time in\nmy life, I made it a habit to lift weights multiple times per week, and in\nthe years that followed, my six-foot-four-inch frame bulked up from a\nfeatherweight 170 to a lean 200 pounds.\nWhen my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on the\npitching staff. By my junior year, I was voted team captain and at the\nend of the season, I was selected for the all-conference team. But it was\nnot until my senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, and\nstrength-training habits really began to pay off.\nSix years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown to\nthe hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male\nathlete at Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-\nAmerica Team—an honor given to just thirty-three players across the\ncountry. By the time I graduated, I was listed in the school record\nbooks in eight different categories. That same year, I was awarded the\nuniversity’s highest academic honor, the President’s Medal.\nI hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, there\nwas nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I never\nended up playing professionally. However, looking back on those\nyears, I believe I accomplished something just as rare: I fulfilled my\npotential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfill\nyour potential as well.\nWe all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the\nexperience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and\nunimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re\nwilling to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the\nlong run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our\nhabits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But\nwith better habits, anything is possible.\nMaybe there are people who can achieve incredible success\novernight. I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them.\nThere wasn’t one defining moment on my journey from medically\ninduced coma to Academic All-American; there were many. It was a\ngradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs.\nThe only way I made progress—the only choice I had—was to start\nsmall. And I employed this same strategy a few years later when I\nstarted my own business and began working on this book.\nHOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK\nIn November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. For\nyears, I had been keeping notes about my personal experiments with\nhabits and I was finally ready to share some of them publicly. I began\nby publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a few\nmonths, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email\nsubscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to more\nthan thirty thousand people.\nIn 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand\nsubscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on\nthe internet. I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years\nearlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits—a new\nlabel that excited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had never\nconsidered myself a master of the topic, but rather someone who was\nexperimenting alongside my readers.\nIn 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and\nsigned a book deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the\nbook you are reading now. As my audience grew, so did my business\nopportunities. I was increasingly asked to speak at top companies\nabout the science of habit formation, behavior change, and continuous\nimprovement. I found myself delivering keynote speeches at\nconferences in the United States and Europe.\nIn 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publications\nlike Time, Entrepreneur, and Forbes. Incredibly, my writing was read\nby over eight million people that year. Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and\nMLB began reading my work and sharing it with their teams.\nAt the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy, which became\nthe premier training platform for organizations and individuals\ninterested in building better habits in life and work.* Fortune 500\ncompanies and growing start-ups began to enroll their leaders and\ntrain their staff. In total, over ten thousand leaders, managers,\ncoaches, and teachers have graduated from the Habits Academy, and\nmy work with them has taught me an incredible amount about what it\ntakes to make habits work in the real world.\nAs I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.com\nis receiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundred\nthousand people subscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number\nthat is so far beyond my expectations when I began that I’m not even\nsure what to think of it.\nHOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOU\nThe entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a\ngreat book, you must first become the book.” I originally learned about\nthe ideas mentioned here because I had to live them. I had to rely on\nsmall habits to rebound from my injury, to get stronger in the gym, to\nperform at a high level on the field, to become a writer, to build a\nsuccessful business, and simply to develop into a responsible adult.\nSmall habits helped me fulfill my potential, and since you picked up\nthis book, I’m guessing you’d like to fulfill yours as well.\nIn the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for building\nbetter habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While science\nsupports everything I’ve written, this book is not an academic research\npaper; it’s an operating manual. You’ll find wisdom and practical\nadvice front and center as I explain the science of how to create and\nchange your habits in a way that is easy to understand and apply.\nThe fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy,\npsychology, and more—have been around for many years. What I offer\nyou is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time\nago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made\nrecently. My contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most\nand connect them in a way that is highly actionable. Anything wise in\nthese pages you should credit to the many experts who preceded me.\nAnything foolish, assume it is my error.\nThe backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue,\ncraving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change\nthat evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background\nmay recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which\nwas first proposed as “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in\nthe 1930s and has been popularized more recently as “cue, routine,\nreward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.\nBehavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the\nright reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain\nway. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how\nexternal stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for\nhow our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal\nstates—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades,\nscientists have begun to determine the connection between our\nthoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in\nthese pages.\nIn total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the\ncognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models\nof human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of\nexternal stimuli and internal emotions on our habits. While some of\nthe language may be familiar, I am confident that the details—and the\napplications of the Four Laws of Behavior Change—will offer a new\nway to think about your habits.\nHuman behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment\nto moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t\nchange. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting\nprinciples you can rely on year after year. The ideas you can build a\nbusiness around, build a family around, build a life around.\nThere is no one right way to create better habits, but this book\ndescribes the best way I know—an approach that will be effective\nregardless of where you start or what you’re trying to change. The\nstrategies I cover will be relevant to anyone looking for a step-by-step\nsystem for improvement, whether your goals center on health, money,\nproductivity, relationships, or all of the above. As long as human\nbehavior is involved, this book will be your guide.\nTHE \nFUNDAMENTALS\nWhy Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference\nT\n1\nThe Surprising Power of Atomic Habits\nHE FATE OF British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The\norganization, which was the governing body for professional\ncycling in Great Britain, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new\nperformance director. At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain\nhad endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity. Since 1908,\nBritish riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games,\nand they had fared even worse in cycling’s biggest race, the Tour de\nFrance. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.\nIn fact, the performance of British riders had been so\nunderwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe\nrefused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would\nhurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear.\nBrailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory.\nWhat made him different from previous coaches was his relentless\ncommitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of\nmarginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny\nmargin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “The\nwhole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything\nyou could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1\npercent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all\ntogether.”\nBrailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you\nmight expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the\nbike seats to make them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the\ntires for a better grip. They asked riders to wear electrically heated\novershorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and used\nbiofeedback sensors to monitor how each athlete responded to a\nparticular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel\nand had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which\nproved to be lighter and more aerodynamic.\nBut they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find\n1 percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They\ntested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest\nmuscle recovery. They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way\nto wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. They\ndetermined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night’s\nsleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team truck\nwhite, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally\nslip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely\ntuned bikes.\nAs these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated,\nthe results came faster than anyone could have imagined.\nJust five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team\ndominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic\nGames in Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the\ngold medals available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games came\nto London, the Brits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records\nand seven world records.\nThat same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to\nwin the Tour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froome\nwon the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017,\ngiving the British team five Tour de France victories in six years.\nDuring the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won\n178 world championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold\nmedals and captured five Tour de France victories in what is widely\nregarded as the most successful run in cycling history.*\nHow does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary\nathletes transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at\nfirst glance, would seem to make a modest difference at best? Why do\nsmall improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and\nhow can you replicate this approach in your own life?\nWHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE\nIt is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment\nand underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily\nbasis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires\nmassive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business,\nwriting a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal,\nwe put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering\nimprovement that everyone will talk about.\nMeanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—\nsometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful,\nespecially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make\nover time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get\n1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times\nbetter by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse\neach day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts\nas a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much\nmore.\n1% BETTER EVERY DAY\n1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03\n1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78\nFIGURE 1: The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if\nyou can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are\nnearly 37 times better after one year.\nHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same\nway that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of\nyour habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little\ndifference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the\nmonths and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two,\nfive, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the\ncost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.\nThis can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often\ndismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in\nthe moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a\nmillionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of\nshape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t\nlearned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never\nseem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.\nUnfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to\nlet a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale\ndoesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family,\nthey will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until\ntomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision\nis easy to dismiss.\nBut when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating\npoor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little\nexcuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the\naccumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—\nthat eventually leads to a problem.\nThe impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect\nof shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you\nare flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from\nLAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in\nWashington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely\nnoticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—\nbut when magnified across the entire United States, you end up\nhundreds of miles apart.*\nSimilarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a\nvery different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1\npercent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of\nmoments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the\ndifference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the\nproduct of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\nThat said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are\nright now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the\npath toward success. You should be far more concerned with your\ncurrent trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire\nbut you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad\ntrajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to end\nwell. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month,\nthen you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re\nmoving slower than you’d like.\nYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth\nis a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging\nmeasure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of\nyour learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning\nhabits. You get what you repeat.\nIf you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do\nis follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily\nchoices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you\nspending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the\ngym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new\neach day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your\nfuture self.\nTime magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will\nmultiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad\nhabits make time your enemy.\nHabits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just\nas easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding\nthe details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to\ndesign them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the\nblade.\nYOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU\nPositive Compounding\nProductivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day,\nbut it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or mastering\na new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more\nyour brain is free to focus on other areas.\nKnowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a\ncommitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not\nonly teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old\nideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound\ninterest.”\nRelationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help\nothers, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result\nin a network of broad and strong connections over time.\nNegative Compounding\nStress compounds. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities.\nThe worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves,\nthese common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little\nstresses compound into serious health issues.\nNegative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly,\nthe more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop.\nThe same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people\nas angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.\nOutrage compounds. Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a single\nevent. Instead, a long series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until\none event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire.\nWHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE\nImagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you.\nThe room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-\nfive degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.\nTwenty-six degrees.\nTwenty-seven.\nTwenty-eight.\nThe ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.\nTwenty-nine degrees.\nThirty.\nThirty-one.\nStill, nothing has happened.\nThen, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift,\nseemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has\nunlocked a huge change.\nBreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous\nactions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major\nchange. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent\nof its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo\ncan barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root\nsystems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within\nsix weeks.\nSimilarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross\na critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early\nand middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of\nDisappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and\nit’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,\nweeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere.\nIt’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful\noutcomes are delayed.\nThis is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that\nlast. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and\ndecide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so\nwhy can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking\ntakes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order\nto make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to\nbreak through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.\nIf you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad\none, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often\nbecause you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.\nComplaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like\ncomplaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from\ntwenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just\nbeing stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.\nWhen you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential,\npeople will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the\nmost dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that\nit’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t\nmaking any progress—that makes the jump today possible.\nIt is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic\nplates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension\nslowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once\nagain, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension\nis too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it\nhappens all at once.\nMastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most\nsuccessful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer\nJacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help,\nI go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a\nhundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the\nhundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that\nlast blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”\nTHE PLATEAU OF LATENT POTENTIAL\nFIGURE 2: We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope\nit will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is\nnot until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous\nwork we have done. This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where\npeople feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work\nwithout experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was\nsimply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous\nefforts is revealed.\nAll big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit\nis a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit\nsprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches\ngrow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak\nwithin us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a\ndelicate flower one day at a time.\nBut what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to\nsurvive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other\nside? What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits\nand enables others to enjoy the compounding effects of good ones?\nFORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD\nPrevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in\nlife—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing\nmore and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—\nis to set specific, actionable goals.\nFor many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one\nwas a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in\nschool, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I\nwanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of\nthem. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do\nwith the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I\nfollowed.\nWhat’s the difference between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I\nfirst learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert\ncomic. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are\nabout the processes that lead to those results.\nIf you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your\nsystem is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant\ncoaches, and conduct practice.\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-\ndollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire\nemployees, and run marketing campaigns.\nIf you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your\nsystem is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle\ndifficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from\nyour instructor.\nNow for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your\ngoals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For\nexample, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to\nwin a championship and focused only on what your team does at\npractice each day, would you still get results?\nI think you would.\nThe goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be\nridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only\nway to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time\nSuper Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The\nsame is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then\nforget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.\nWhat do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course\nnot. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for\nmaking progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too\nmuch time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing\nyour systems.\nProblem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.\nGoal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We\nconcentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and\nmistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while\noverlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t\nsucceed.\nEvery Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants\nto get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the\nsame goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners\nfrom the losers. It wasn’t the goal of winning the Tour de France that\npropelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they\nhad wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other\nprofessional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when\nthey implemented a system of continuous small improvements that\nthey achieved a different outcome.\nProblem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you\nsummon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for\nnow. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a\nmessy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of\nclutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing\nthe same outcome because you never changed the system behind it.\nYou treated a symptom without addressing the cause.\nAchieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the\ncounterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to\nchange our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really\nneed to change are the systems that cause those results. When you\nsolve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In\norder to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems\nlevel. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.\nProblem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.\nThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal,\nthen I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that\nyou’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I’ve\nslipped into this trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years,\nhappiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I\npromised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after\nmy business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally\nrelax.\nFurthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve\nyour goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.\nYou mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is\nmisguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match\nthe exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense\nto restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths\nto success.\nA systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in\nlove with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to\ngive yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime\nyour system is running. And a system can be successful in many\ndifferent forms, not just the one you first envision.\nProblem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.\nFinally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many\nrunners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line,\nthey stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When\nall of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to\npush you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find\nthemselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.\nThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of\nbuilding systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term\nthinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single\naccomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and\ncontinuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the\nprocess that will determine your progress.\nA SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS\nIf you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you.\nThe problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and\nagain not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the\nwrong system for change.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your\nsystems.\nFocusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of\nthe core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings\nbehind the word atomic. By now, you’ve probably realized that an\natomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent\nimprovement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however\nsmall. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as\natoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the\nbuilding blocks of remarkable results.\nHabits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental\nunit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny\nroutines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel\nbigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of\ntheir initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the\nmeaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine\nthat is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible\npower; a component of the system of compound growth.\nChapter Summary\nHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1\npercent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\nHabits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or\nagainst you, which is why understanding the details is essential.\nSmall changes often appear to make no difference until you cross\na critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any\ncompounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.\nAn atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just\nas atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are\nthe building blocks of remarkable results.\nIf you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus\non your system instead.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of\nyour systems.\nW\n2\nHow Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and\nVice Versa)\nHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good\nones? Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life\nthan improving your daily habits. And yet it is likely that this time next\nyear you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better.\nIt often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few\ndays, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.\nHabits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are\nreasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.\nHowever, once your habits are established, they seem to stick\naround forever—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best\nintentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much\ntelevision, procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.\nChanging our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to\nchange the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the\nwrong way. In this chapter, I’ll address the first point. In the chapters\nthat follow, I’ll answer the second.\nOur first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To\nunderstand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which\nchange can occur. You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.\nTHREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE\nFIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your\noutcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.\nThe first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is\nconcerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a\nbook, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are\nassociated with this level of change.\nThe second layer is changing your process. This level is\nconcerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a\nnew routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow,\ndeveloping a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are\nassociated with this level.\nThe third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This\nlevel is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your\nself-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the\nbeliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.\nOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do.\nIdentity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habits\nthat last—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent\nimprovements—the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse”\nthan another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. The\nproblem is the direction of change.\nMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing\non what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits.\nThe alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach,\nwe start by focusing on who we wish to become.\nOUTCOME-BASED HABITS\nIDENTITY-BASED HABITS\nFIGURE 4: With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to\nachieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to\nbecome.\nImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the\nfirst person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a\nreasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker\nwho is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will\nchange while carrying around the same beliefs.\nThe second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a\nsmoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in\nidentity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one.\nThey no longer identify as someone who smokes.\nMost people don’t even consider identity change when they set out\nto improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I\nstick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and\ndetermine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without\nconsidering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the\nway they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old\nidentity can sabotage their new plans for change.\nBehind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of\na democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and\nsocial equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of\nbeliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imagine\nmany ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such\nbehavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship.\nThat’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is\nimpossible under a certain set of beliefs.\nA similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals,\norganizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions\nthat shape the system, an identity behind the habits.\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may\nwant more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes\nrather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending\nrather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to\nprioritize comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing\nrather than training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never\nchange the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have\na new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.\nThe story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado,\nprovides a good example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed\nmy fingernails,” Clark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I\nwas young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual.\nOne day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.\nThrough mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”\nThen, Clark did something surprising.\n“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said. “My\nthought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t\nchew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What\nhappened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the\nfirst time. The manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I\nhad really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my\nfingernails. And even though that’s something I had never aspired to, it\nmade all the difference. I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a\nsingle close call. And it’s because I now take pride in properly caring\nfor them.”\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes\npart of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who\nwants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person\nwho is this.\nThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the\nmore motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If\nyou’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to\ncare for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps,\nyou’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re\nproud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours\nknitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth\nand nail to maintain your habits.\nTrue behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit\nbecause of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that\nit becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to\nvisit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the\nbelief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term\nchanges. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of\nwho you are.\nThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.\nThe goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.\nThe goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a\nmusician.\nYour behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do\nis an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either\nconsciously or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a\nperson believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more\nlikely to act in alignment with that belief. For example, people who\nidentified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than those who\nsimply claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to perform.\nSimilarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity\ndoesn’t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is\neasy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned,\nyou are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like\nthe type of person you already believe yourself to be.\nLike all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged\nsword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force\nfor self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity\nchange can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be\neasy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many\npeople walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the\nnorms attached to their identity.\n“I’m terrible with directions.”\n“I’m not a morning person.”\n“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”\n“I’m always late.”\n“I’m not good with technology.”\n“I’m horrible at math.”\n. . . and a thousand other variations.\nWhen you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to\nslide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you\nbegin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is\ninternal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that\nis consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid\ncontradicting yourself.\nThe more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the\nmore difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what\nyour culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-\nimage (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to\npositive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity\nconflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with\nyour identity, you will fail to put them into action.\nOn any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re\ntoo busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons.\nOver the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits\nis that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too\nattached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning.\nBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit\nyour beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\nThis brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and\nworldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they\ncome from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed?\nAnd how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve\nyou and gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?\nTHE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset\nbeliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and\nconditioned through experience.*\nMore precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity.\nWhen you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an\norganized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity\nof a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity\nof an athletic person.\nThe more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity\nassociated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally\nderived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and\nidentidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your\n“repeated beingness.”\nWhatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you\nhave proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you\nhave evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour\nevery night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the\ngym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed\nto fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly\nyou will believe it.\nFor most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a writer. If you\nwere to ask any of my high school teachers or college professors, they\nwould tell you I was an average writer at best: certainly not a standout.\nWhen I began my writing career, I published a new article every\nMonday and Thursday for the first few years. As the evidence grew, so\ndid my identity as a writer. I didn’t start out as a writer. I became one\nthrough my habits.\nOf course, your habits are not the only actions that influence your\nidentity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most\nimportant ones. Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but\nit’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you\nkicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you\nrepeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-\nimage begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade\naway while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means\nyour habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.\nIn this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of\nbecoming yourself.\nThis is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our\nfingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit,\nday by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing\nmicroevolutions of the self.\nEach habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you\nfinish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes\nreading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person\nwho likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are\nthe type of person who likes music.\nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to\nbecome. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes\nbuild up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason\nwhy meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits\ncan make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new\nidentity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the\nparadox of making small improvements.\nPutting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to\nchanging your identity. The most practical way to change who you are\nis to change what you do.\nEach time you write a page, you are a writer.\nEach time you practice the violin, you are a musician.\nEach time you start a workout, you are an athlete.\nEach time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.\nEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far\nmore important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually\naccomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence\nbegins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.\nOf course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to\nperform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that\nyou don’t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be votes\nfor both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election;\nyou just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a\nbad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the\nmajority of the time.\nNew identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same\nvotes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve\nalways had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.\nIt is a simple two-step process:\n1. Decide the type of person you want to be.\n2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\nFirst, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an\nindividual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want\nto stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to\nbecome?\nThese are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to begin\n—but they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack abs\nor to feel less anxious or to double their salary. That’s fine. Start there\nand work backward from the results you want to the type of person\nwho could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person\nthat could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person that\ncould lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn a\nnew language? Who is the type of person that could run a successful\nstart-up?\nFor example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?”\nIt’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus\nshifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person\nwho is consistent and reliable (identity-based).\nThis process can lead to beliefs like:\n“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.”\n“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and\nempathy they need.”\n“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”\nOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you\ncan begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a\nfriend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a\nhealthy person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a\nguide. Would a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy\nperson order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthy\nperson long enough, eventually she would become that person. She\nwas right.\nThe concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to\nanother key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape\nyour identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way\nstreet. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will\nexplore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your\nvalues, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.\nThe focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not\ngetting a particular outcome.\nTHE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER\nIdentity change is the North Star of habit change. The remainder of\nthis book will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to\nbuild better habits in yourself, your family, your team, your company,\nand anywhere else you wish. But the true question is: “Are you\nbecoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not\nwhat or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.\nOtherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And\nthat’s why we are starting here.\nYou have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your\nidentity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You\ncan choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you\nchoose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book\nand the real reason habits matter.\nBuilding better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks.\nIt’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower\neach morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about\nachieving external measures of success like earning more money,\nlosing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of\nthese things, but fundamentally they are not about having something.\nThey are about becoming someone.\nUltimately, your habits matter because they help you become the\ntype of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you\ndevelop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become\nyour habits.\nChapter Summary\nThere are three levels of change: outcome change, process change,\nand identity change.\nThe most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on\nwhat you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for\nthe type of person you wish to become.\nBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to\ncontinuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your\nidentity.\nThe real reason habits matter is not because they can get you\nbetter results (although they can do that), but because they can\nchange your beliefs about yourself.\nI\n3\nHow to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple\nSteps\nN 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an\nexperiment that would lay the foundation for our understanding of\nhow habits form and the rules that guide our behavior. Thorndike was\ninterested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by\nworking with cats.\nHe would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The\nbox was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “by some\nsimple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or\nstepping on a platform.” For example, one box contained a lever that,\nwhen pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door\nhad been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.\nMost cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the\nbox. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws\nthrough openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of\nexploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door\nwould open, and they would escape.\nThorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In\nthe beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as\nsoon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of\nlearning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of\npressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to\nthe food.\nAfter twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and\nhabitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example,\nThorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act.\n160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20,\n12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”\nDuring the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5\nminutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3\nseconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions\nbecame quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the same\nmistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.\nFrom his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by\nstating, “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be\nrepeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less\nlikely to be repeated.” His work provides the perfect starting point for\ndiscussing how habits form in our own lives. It also provides answers\nto some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And why does\nthe brain bother building them at all?\nWHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become\nautomatic. The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.\nWhenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to\nmake a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come\nacross a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat,\nyou’re just trying things out to see what works.\nNeurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are\ncarefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about\nhow to act. You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to\nmake sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective\ncourse of action.\nOccasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a\nsolution. You’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run\ncalms you down. You’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work,\nand you learn that playing video games relaxes you. You’re exploring,\nexploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.\nAfter you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your\nstrategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the\nevents that preceded the reward. Wait a minute—that felt good. What\ndid I do right before that?\nThis is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn,\ntry differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and\nthe useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.\nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to\nautomate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of\nautomatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face\nregularly. As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are,\nsimply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”\nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases.\nYou learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out\neverything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know\nexactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every\nangle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and\ncreates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive scripts can be\nfollowed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate. Now,\nwhenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as you walk\nin the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choice\nthat once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created.\nHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a\nhabit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a\nproblem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw\non this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The\nprimary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what\nwill work in the future.\nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is\nthe bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at\na time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your\nconscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever\npossible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the\nnonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens\nwhen a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up\nmental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.\nDespite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits\nof habits. The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull? I\ndon’t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy. Doesn’t\nso much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?”\nHardly. Such questions set up a false dichotomy. They make you think\nthat you have to choose between building habits and attaining\nfreedom. In reality, the two complement each other.\nHabits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people\nwho don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least\namount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be\nstruggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will\nalways seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you\nwill always feel like you’re behind the curve. If you’re always being\nforced to make decisions about simple tasks—when should I work out,\nwhere do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have less time\nfor freedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that\nyou can create the mental space needed for free thinking and\ncreativity.\nConversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of\nlife are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges\nand master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present\nallows you to do more of what you want in the future.\nTHE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK\nThe process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps:\ncue, craving, response, and reward.* Breaking it down into these\nfundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it\nworks, and how to improve it.\nFIGURE 5: All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue,\ncraving, response, and reward.\nThis four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain\nruns through these steps in the same order each time.\nFirst, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a\nbehavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our\nprehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the\nlocation of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend\nmost of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like\nmoney and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and\nfriendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these\npursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction,\nwhich is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)\nYour mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external\nenvironment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is\nthe first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a\ncraving.\nCravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force\nbehind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—\nwithout craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is\nnot the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave\nsmoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are\nnot motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a\nclean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be\nentertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal\nstate. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.\nCravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of\ninformation could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not\nmotivated by the same cues. For a gambler, the sound of slot machines\ncan be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For\nsomeone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are\njust background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.\nThe thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what\ntransform a cue into a craving.\nThe third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you\nperform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a\nresponse occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much\nfriction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires\nmore physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you\nwon’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds\nsimple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you\nwant to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough to reach the\nhoop, well, you’re out of luck.\nFinally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of\nevery habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about\nwanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We\nchase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and\n(2) they teach us.\nThe first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards\nprovide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you\nneed to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect.\nGetting in shape improves your health and your dating prospects. But\nthe more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat\nor to gain status or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewards\ndeliver contentment and relief from craving.\nSecond, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in\nthe future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life,\nyour sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions\nsatisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and\ndisappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your\nbrain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the\nfeedback loop and complete the habit cycle.\nIf a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not\nbecome a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.\nReduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to\nact. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if\nthe reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do\nit again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not\noccur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.\nTHE HABIT LOOP\nFIGURE 6: The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop.\nThey form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This\n“habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will\nhappen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.*\nIn summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response,\nwhich provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately,\nbecomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a\nneurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue,\ncraving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create\nautomatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.\nThis four-step process is not something that happens occasionally,\nbut rather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active\nduring every moment you are alive—even now. The brain is continually\nscanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying\nout different responses, and learning from the results. The entire\nprocess is completed in a split second, and we use it again and again\nwithout realizing everything that has been packed into the previous\nmoment.\nWe can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase\nand the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the\ncraving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The\nsolution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when\nyou take action and achieve the change you desire.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\nSolution phase\n3. Response\n4. Reward\nAll behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes\nthe problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain\nit. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you\nwant to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the\nproblems you face.\nIn the table on the following page, you can see a few examples of\nwhat this looks like in real life.\nImagine walking into a dark room and flipping on the light switch.\nYou have performed this simple habit so many times that it occurs\nwithout thinking. You proceed through all four stages in the fraction of\na second. The urge to act strikes you without thinking.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: Your phone buzzes with a new text message.\n2. Craving: You want to learn the contents of the message.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You grab your phone and read the text.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes\nassociated with your phone buzzing.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You are answering emails.\n2. Craving: You begin to feel stressed and overwhelmed by work. You want to feel in control.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You bite your nails.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to reduce stress. Biting your nails becomes associated\nwith answering email.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You wake up.\n2. Craving: You want to feel alert.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You drink a cup of coffee.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to feel alert. Drinking coffee becomes associated with\nwaking up.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You smell a doughnut shop as you walk down the street near your office.\n2. Craving: You begin to crave a doughnut.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You buy a doughnut and eat it.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to eat a doughnut. Buying a doughnut becomes\nassociated with walking down the street near your office.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You hit a stumbling block on a project at work.\n2. Craving: You feel stuck and want to relieve your frustration.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You pull out your phone and check social media.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to feel relieved. Checking social media becomes\nassociated with feeling stalled at work.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You walk into a dark room.\n2. Craving: You want to be able to see.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You flip the light switch.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to see. Turning on the light switch becomes associated\nwith being in a dark room.\nBy the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are\nrunning our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the fact\nthat we tie the same shoe first each morning, or unplug the toaster\nafter each use, or always change into comfortable clothes after getting\nhome from work. After decades of mental programming, we\nautomatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.\nTHE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE\nIn the following chapters, we will see time and again how the four\nstages of cue, craving, response, and reward influence nearly\neverything we do each day. But before we do that, we need to\ntransform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use\nto design good habits and eliminate bad ones.\nI refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and\nit provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking\nbad ones. You can think of each law as a lever that influences human\nbehavior. When the levers are in the right positions, creating good\nhabits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly\nimpossible.\nHow to Create a Good Habit\nThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.\nThe 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.\nThe 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.\nThe 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.\nWe can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.\nHow to Break a Bad Habit\nInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.\nInversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.\nInversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.\nInversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.\nIt would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four laws are an\nexhaustive framework for changing any human behavior, but I think\nthey’re close. As you will soon see, the Four Laws of Behavior Change\napply to nearly every field, from sports to politics, art to medicine,\ncomedy to management. These laws can be used no matter what\nchallenge you are facing. There is no need for completely different\nstrategies for each habit.\nWhenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask\nyourself:\n1. How can I make it obvious?\n2. How can I make it attractive?\n3. How can I make it easy?\n4. How can I make it satisfying?\nIf you have ever wondered, “Why don’t I do what I say I’m going to\ndo? Why don’t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirement\nor start that side business? Why do I say something is important but\nnever seem to make time for it?” The answers to those questions can be\nfound somewhere in these four laws. The key to creating good habits\nand breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws and\nhow to alter them to your specifications. Every goal is doomed to fail if\nit goes against the grain of human nature.\nYour habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chapters\nthat follow, we will discuss these laws one by one and show how you\ncan use them to create a system in which good habits emerge naturally\nand bad habits wither away.\nChapter Summary\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to\nbecome automatic.\nThe ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with\nas little energy and effort as possible.\nAny habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves\nfour steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.\nThe Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we\ncan use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2)\nmake it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.\nTHE 1ST LAW\nMake It Obvious\n4\nThe Man Who Didn’t Look Right\nTHE PSYCHOLOGIST GARY Klein once told me a story about a woman who\nattended a family gathering. She had spent years working as a\nparamedic and, upon arriving at the event, took one look at her father-\nin-law and got very concerned.\n“I don’t like the way you look,” she said.\nHer father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied,\n“Well, I don’t like your looks, either.”\n“No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.”\nA few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery after\nan examination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery\nand was at immediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in-\nlaw’s intuition, he could have died.\nWhat did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending\nheart attack?\nWhen major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending\nblood to critical organs and away from peripheral locations near the\nsurface of the skin. The result is a change in the pattern of distribution\nof blood in the face. After many years of working with people with\nheart failure, the woman had unknowingly developed the ability to\nrecognize this pattern on sight. She couldn’t explain what it was that\nshe noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but she knew something was\nwrong.\nSimilar stories exist in other fields. For example, military analysts\ncan identify which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile and\nwhich one is a plane from their own fleet even though they are\ntraveling at the same speed, flying at the same altitude, and look\nidentical on radar in nearly every respect. During the Gulf War,\nLieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship when\nhe ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly\nlike the battleship’s own planes on radar. He made the right call, but\neven his superior officers couldn’t explain how he did it.\nMuseum curators have been known to discern the difference\nbetween an authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit\neven though they can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off.\nExperienced radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area\nwhere a stroke will develop before any obvious signs are visible to the\nuntrained eye. I’ve even heard of hairdressers noticing whether a client\nis pregnant based only on the feel of her hair.\nThe human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking\nin your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.\nWhenever you experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic\nseeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a\nmissile on a radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is\nimportant, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant\ncues, and cataloging that information for future use.\nWith enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict\ncertain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically,\nyour brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t\nalways explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all\nalong the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given\nsituation is the foundation for every habit you have.\nWe underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without\nthinking. You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your\nlungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles\nall this and more on autopilot. You are much more than your conscious\nself.\nConsider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t\nnecessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time\nto eat. Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body\nhas a variety of feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time\nto eat again and that track what is going on around you and within you.\nCravings can arise thanks to hormones and chemicals circulating\nthrough your body. Suddenly, you’re hungry even though you’re not\nquite sure what tipped you off.\nThis is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you\ndon’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an\nopportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to\nit. This is what makes habits useful.\nIt’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions\ncome under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind.\nYou fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless\nsomeone points it out, you may not notice that you cover your mouth\nwith your hand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking a\nquestion, or that you have a habit of finishing other people’s sentences.\nAnd the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you become to\nquestion what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.\nI once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty gift\ncards after customers had used up the balance on the card. One day,\nthe clerk cashed out a few customers in a row who purchased with gift\ncards. When the next person walked up, the clerk swiped the\ncustomer’s actual credit card, picked up the scissors, and then cut it in\nhalf—entirely on autopilot—before looking up at the stunned customer\nand realizing what had just happened.\nAnother woman I came across in my research was a former\npreschool teacher who had switched to a corporate job. Even though\nshe was now working with adults, her old habits would kick in and she\nkept asking coworkers if they had washed their hands after going to the\nbathroom. I also found the story of a man who had spent years\nworking as a lifeguard and would occasionally yell “Walk!” whenever\nhe saw a child running.\nOver time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that\nthey are essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the\nremote control next to the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our\nresponses to these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the\nurge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the\nprocess of behavior change with awareness.\nBefore we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle\non our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds\nbecause once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly\nnonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t\nexpect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you\nmake the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will\ncall it fate.”\nTHE HABITS SCORECARD\nThe Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the\nworld. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice\nthat the conductors have a peculiar habit.\nAs each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of\npointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train\napproaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is\ngreen.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will\npoint at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s time\nto leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out\non the platform, other employees are performing similar actions.\nBefore each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of\nthe platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified, pointed\nat, and named aloud.*\nThis process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system\ndesigned to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly\nwell. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts\naccidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City\nadopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years\nof implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57\npercent.”\nPointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of\nawareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.\nBecause the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and\nears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes\nwrong.\nMy wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to\nwalk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential\nitems in her packing list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got\nmy glasses. I’ve got my husband.”\nThe more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to\nconsciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a\nthousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that\nthe next time will be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what\nwe’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right\nthing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely\nattributable to a lack of self-awareness.\nOne of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining\nawareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the\nconsequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-\ncall” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits\nScorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more\naware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily\nhabits.\nHere’s a sample of where your list might start:\nWake up\nTurn off alarm\nCheck my phone\nGo to the bathroom\nWeigh myself\nTake a shower\nBrush my teeth\nFloss my teeth\nPut on deodorant\nHang up towel to dry\nGet dressed\nMake a cup of tea\n. . . and so on.\nOnce you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is\nthis a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit,\nwrite “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit,\nwrite “=”.\nFor example, the list above might look like this:\nWake up =\nTurn off alarm =\nCheck my phone –\nGo to the bathroom =\nWeigh myself +\nTake a shower +\nBrush my teeth +\nFloss my teeth +\nPut on deodorant +\nHang up towel to dry =\nGet dressed =\nMake a cup of tea +\nThe marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your\nsituation and your goals. For someone who is trying to lose weight,\neating a bagel with peanut butter every morning might be a bad habit.\nFor someone who is trying to bulk up and add muscle, the same\nbehavior might be a good habit. It all depends on what you’re working\ntoward.*\nScoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason as\nwell. The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate.\nThere are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits.\nThat is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way\n—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. For this exercise,\ncategorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run.\nGenerally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad\nhabits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce\nstress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy\nlong-term behavior.\nIf you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular\nhabit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me\nbecome the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for\nor against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired\nidentity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired\nidentity are usually bad.\nAs you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change\nanything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on.\nObserve your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal\ncriticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for\nyour successes.\nIf you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as\nif you were watching someone else. Oh, how interesting that they\nwould do such a thing. If you binge-eat, simply notice that you are\neating more calories than you should. If you waste time online, notice\nthat you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to.\nThe first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for\nthem. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-\nand-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you are\nthinking of taking and what the outcome will be. If you want to cut\nback on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another\ncookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need it.\nEating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.”\nHearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences\nseem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting\nyourself mindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is useful\neven if you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list. Just\nsaying out loud, “Tomorrow, I need to go to the post office after lunch,”\nincreases the odds that you’ll actually do it. You’re getting yourself to\nacknowledge the need for action—and that can make all the difference.\nThe process of behavior change always starts with awareness.\nStrategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are\nfocused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the\ncues that trigger them, which makes it possible to respond in a way\nthat benefits you.\nChapter Summary\nWith enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that\npredict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.\nOnce our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to\nwhat we are doing.\nThe process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You\nneed to be aware of your habits before you can change them.\nPointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a\nnonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your\nactions.\nThe Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become\nmore aware of your behavior.\nI\n5\nThe Best Way to Start a New Habit\nN 2001, RESEARCHERS in Great Britain began working with 248 people\nto build better exercise habits over the course of two weeks. The\nsubjects were divided into three groups.\nThe first group was the control group. They were simply asked to\ntrack how often they exercised.\nThe second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not\nonly to track their workouts but also to read some material on the\nbenefits of exercise. The researchers also explained to the group how\nexercise could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve\nheart health.\nFinally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same\npresentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal\nlevels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan\nfor when and where they would exercise over the following week.\nSpecifically, each member of the third group completed the following\nsentence: “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes\nof vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”\nIn the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised\nat least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation\ngiven to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on\nbehavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per\nweek—more than double the normal rate.\nThe sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an\nimplementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about\nwhen and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a\nparticular habit.\nThe cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the\nfeel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip\ncookies, the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common\ncues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of\nthese cues.\nBroadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation\nintention is:\n“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”\nHundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are\neffective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact\ntime and date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time of\nyour colonoscopy appointment. They increase the odds that people will\nstick with habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early, and\nstopping smoking.\nResearchers have even found that voter turnout increases when\npeople are forced to create implementation intentions by answering\nquestions like: “What route are you taking to the polling station? At\nwhat time are you planning to go? What bus will get you there?” Other\nsuccessful government programs have prompted citizens to make a\nclear plan to send taxes in on time or provided directions on when and\nwhere to pay late traffic bills.\nThe punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when\nand where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow\nthrough. Too many people try to change their habits without these\nbasic details figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier”\nor “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these\nhabits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we\nwill “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time. An\nimplementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like “I want to\nwork out more” or “I want to be more productive” or “I should vote”\nand transforms them into a concrete plan of action.\nMany people think they lack motivation when what they really lack\nis clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some\npeople spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make\nan improvement.\nOnce an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to\nwait for inspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I\nmeditate this morning or at lunch? When the moment of action\noccurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your\npredetermined plan.\nThe simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill\nout this sentence:\nI will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].\nMeditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.\nStudying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my\nbedroom.\nExercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.\nMarriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the\nkitchen.\nIf you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the\nweek, month, or year. People are more likely to take action at those\ntimes because hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a\nreason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating.\nThere is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being\nspecific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say\nno to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you\noff course. We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear\nenough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams\nare vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never\nget around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.\nGive your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is\nto make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition,\nyou get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t\nsay why. As the writer Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never\ngoing to just work out without conscious thought. But like a dog\nsalivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day\nyou normally work out.”\nThere are many ways to use implementation intentions in your life\nand work. My favorite approach is one I learned from Stanford\nprofessor BJ Fogg and it is a strategy I refer to as habit stacking.\nHABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR\nHABITS\nThe French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in\npoverty, but that all changed one day in 1765.\nDiderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could not afford\nto pay for the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well\nknown for his role as the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, one of\nthe most comprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine\nthe Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s financial troubles,\nher heart went out to him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed his\nencyclopedia. She offered to buy Diderot’s personal library for £1,000\n—more than $150,000 today.* Suddenly, Diderot had money to spare.\nWith his new wealth, he not only paid for the wedding but also\nacquired a scarlet robe for himself.\nDiderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he\nimmediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by\nhis more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more\ncoordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe\nand the rest of his stuff.\nDiderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced\nhis rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with\nexpensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel,\nand a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a\nleather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.\nDiderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one\npurchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The\nDiderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a\nspiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.\nYou can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to\nget new shoes and earrings to match. You buy a couch and suddenly\nquestion the layout of your entire living room. You buy a toy for your\nchild and soon find yourself purchasing all of the accessories that go\nwith it. It’s a chain reaction of purchases.\nMany human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to\ndo next based on what you have just finished doing. Going to the\nbathroom leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you\nthat you need to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry\ndetergent to the shopping list, and so on. No behavior happens in\nisolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.\nWhy is this important?\nWhen it comes to building new habits, you can use the\nconnectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to\nbuild a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day\nand then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.\nHabit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention.\nRather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location,\nyou pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ\nFogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an\nobvious cue for nearly any habit.*\nThe habit stacking formula is:\n“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\nFor example:\nMeditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will\nmeditate for one minute.\nExercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately\nchange into my workout clothes.\nGratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m\ngrateful for that happened today.\nMarriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a\nkiss.\nSafety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or\nfamily member where I am running and how long it will take.\nThe key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already\ndo each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can\nbegin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This\nallows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes\nfrom one behavior leading into the next—a positive version of the\nDiderot Effect.\nHABIT STACKING\nFIGURE 7: Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a\nhabit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can\nbe repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the cue\nfor the next.\nYour morning routine habit stack might look like this:\n1. After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty\nseconds.\n2. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for\nthe day.\n3. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin\nmy first task.\nOr, consider this habit stack in the evening:\n1. After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the\ndishwasher.\n2. After I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the\ncounter.\n3. After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for\ntomorrow morning.\nYou can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current\nroutines. For example, you may already have a morning routine that\nlooks like this: Wake up > Make my bed > Take a shower. Let’s say you\nwant to develop the habit of reading more each night. You can expand\nyour habit stack and try something like: Wake up > Make my bed >\nPlace a book on my pillow > Take a shower. Now, when you climb into\nbed each night, a book will be sitting there waiting for you to enjoy.\nOverall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that\nguide your future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan for\nwhich action should come next. Once you get comfortable with this\napproach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever\nthe situation is appropriate:\nExercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of\nusing the elevator.\nSocial skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to\nsomeone I don’t know yet.\nFinances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait\ntwenty-four hours before purchasing.\nHealthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put\nveggies on my plate first.\nMinimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away.\n(“One in, one out.”)\nMood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and\nsmile before answering.\nForgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table\nand chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.\nNo matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a\nsuccessful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.\nUnlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time\nand location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the time\nand location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit\ninto your daily routine can make a big difference. If you’re trying to\nadd meditation into your morning routine but mornings are chaotic\nand your kids keep running into the room, then that may be the wrong\nplace and time. Consider when you are most likely to be successful.\nDon’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with\nsomething else.\nYour cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit.\nIf you want to do a habit every day, but you stack it on top of a habit\nthat only happens on Mondays, that’s not a good choice.\nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by\nbrainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your Habits\nScorecard from the last chapter as a starting point. Alternatively, you\ncan create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down the\nhabits you do each day without fail.*\nFor example:\nGet out of bed.\nTake a shower.\nBrush your teeth.\nGet dressed.\nBrew a cup of coffee.\nEat breakfast.\nTake the kids to school.\nStart the work day.\nEat lunch.\nEnd the work day.\nChange out of work clothes.\nSit down for dinner.\nTurn off the lights.\nGet into bed.\nYour list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the second\ncolumn, write down all of the things that happen to you each day\nwithout fail. For example:\nThe sun rises.\nYou get a text message.\nThe song you are listening to ends.\nThe sun sets.\nArmed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best\nplace to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.\nHabit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and\nimmediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. I\nmade this mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my\nhabit stack was “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.”\nAt first glance, this sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger\nwas unclear. Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After I ate\nlunch? Where would I do them? After a few inconsistent days, I\nchanged my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do\nten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.\nHabits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these\ngoals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific\nand clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit\ndown at the table. The specificity is important. The more tightly bound\nyour new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will\nnotice when the time comes to act.\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies\nlike implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most\npractical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear\nplan for when and where to take action.\nChapter Summary\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.\nThe two most common cues are time and location.\nCreating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to\npair a new habit with a specific time and location.\nThe implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at\n[TIME] in [LOCATION].\nHabit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a\ncurrent habit.\nThe habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will\n[NEW HABIT].\nAFTER\n6\nMotivation Is Overrated; Environment\nOften Matters More\nANNE THORNDIKE, A primary care physician at Massachusetts General\nHospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improve\nthe eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors without\nchanging their willpower or motivation in the slightest way. In fact, she\ndidn’t plan on talking to them at all.\nThorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter\nthe “choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria. They started by\nchanging how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the\nrefrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria were\nfilled with only soda. The researchers added water as an option to each\none. Additionally, they placed baskets of bottled water next to the food\nstations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary\nrefrigerators, but water was now available at all drink locations.\nOver the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital\ndropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increased\nby 25.8 percent. They made similar adjustments—and saw similar\nresults—with the food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word to\nanyone eating there.\nBEFORE\nFIGURE 8: Here is a representation of what the cafeteria looked like before\nthe environment design changes were made (left) and after (right). The\nshaded boxes indicate areas where bottled water was available in each\ninstance. Because the amount of water in the environment was increased,\nbehavior shifted naturally and without additional motivation.\nPeople often choose products not because of what they are, but\nbecause of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of\ncookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if\nI hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily\nfeel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with\ndoughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to grab one every now\nand then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and\nthe cues in front of you.\nEnvironment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.\nDespite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again\nand again under certain environmental conditions. In church, people\ntend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded.\nIn this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but\nexternal: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is\ncontext dependent.\nIn 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that\nmakes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in\ntheir Environment, or B = f (P,E).\nIt didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business. In\n1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called\nSuggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a\nproduct for the first time and visualizes a need for it.” In other words,\ncustomers will occasionally buy products not because they want them\nbut because of how they are presented to them.\nFor example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than\nthose down near the floor. For this reason, you’ll find expensive brand\nnames featured in easy-to-reach locations on store shelves because\nthey drive the most profit, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away\nin harder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which are the\nunits at the end of aisles. End caps are moneymaking machines for\nretailers because they are obvious locations that encounter a lot of foot\ntraffic. For example, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come specifically\nfrom end-of-the-aisle racks.\nThe more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely\nyou are to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and\nvisit Starbucks because it is on every corner. We like to think that we\nare in control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because\nwe wanted to do so. The truth, however, is that many of the actions we\ntake each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the\nmost obvious option.\nEvery living being has its own methods for sensing and\nunderstanding the world. Eagles have remarkable long-distance vision.\nSnakes can smell by “tasting the air” with their highly sensitive\ntongues. Sharks can detect small amounts of electricity and vibrations\nin the water caused by nearby fish. Even bacteria have chemoreceptors\n—tiny sensory cells that allow them to detect toxic chemicals in their\nenvironment.\nIn humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system.\nWe perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.\nBut we also have other ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious,\nbut many are nonconscious. For instance, you can “notice” when the\ntemperature drops before a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises\nduring a stomachache, or when you fall off balance while walking on\nrocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide range of\ninternal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your blood or the need to\ndrink when thirsty.\nThe most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision.\nThe human body has about eleven million sensory receptors.\nApproximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some\nexperts estimate that half of the brain’s resources are used on vision.\nGiven that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it\nshould come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of\nour behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead\nto a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how\nimportant it is to live and work in environments that are filled with\nproductive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.\nThankfully, there is good news in this respect. You don’t have to be\nthe victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.\nHOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS\nDuring the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutch\nresearchers began to pay close attention to the country’s energy usage.\nIn one suburb near Amsterdam, they found that some homeowners\nused 30 percent less energy than their neighbors—despite the homes\nbeing of similar size and getting electricity for the same price.\nIt turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical\nexcept for one feature: the location of the electrical meter. Some had\none in the basement. Others had the electrical meter upstairs in the\nmain hallway. As you may guess, the homes with the meters located in\nthe main hallway used less electricity. When their energy use was\nobvious and easy to track, people changed their behavior.\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice\ncues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live\nand work often make it easy not to do certain actions because there is\nno obvious cue to trigger the behavior. It’s easy not to practice the\nguitar when it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a book\nwhen the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room. It’s easy not to\ntake your vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry. When the\ncues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.\nBy comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your\nattention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff\nat Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked\nlike a fly near the center of each urinal. Apparently, when men stepped\nup to the urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug. The\nstickers improved their aim and significantly reduced “spillage” around\nthe urinals. Further analysis determined that the stickers cut bathroom\ncleaning costs by 8 percent per year.\nI’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. I used to\nbuy apples from the store, put them in the crisper in the bottom of the\nrefrigerator, and forget all about them. By the time I remembered, the\napples would have gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.\nEventually, I took my own advice and redesigned my environment. I\nbought a large display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchen\ncounter. The next time I bought apples, that was where they went—out\nin the open where I could see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a\nfew apples each day simply because they were obvious rather than out\nof sight.\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make\nthe cues for your preferred habits more obvious:\nIf you want to remember to take your medication each night, put\nyour pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom\ncounter.\nIf you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar\nstand in the middle of the living room.\nIf you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a\nstack of stationery on your desk.\nIf you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each\nmorning and place them in common locations around the house.\nIf you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big\npart of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have\nmultiple cues. Consider how many different ways a smoker could be\nprompted to pull out a cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend\nsmoke, feeling stressed at work, and so on.\nThe same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling\ntriggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that\nyou’ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best\nchoice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and\nnatural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.\nEnvironment design is powerful not only because it influences how\nwe engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people\nlive in a world others have created for them. But you can alter the\nspaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive\ncues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment design\nallows you to take back control and become the architect of your life.\nBe the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.\nTHE CONTEXT IS THE CUE\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time\nyour habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the\nentire context surrounding the behavior.\nFor example, many people drink more in social situations than they\nwould ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the\nwhole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music\nat the bar, seeing the beers on tap.\nWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur:\nthe home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to\ncertain habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship with\nthe objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the things\nin your bedroom.\nOur behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by\nour relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the\ninfluence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about\nyour environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled\nwith relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces\naround you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for\nan hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches\ntelevision and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people can\nhave different memories—and thus different habits—associated with\nthe same place.\nThe good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with\na particular context.\nIn one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only\nwhen they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit\nin a different room until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects began\nto associate the context of their bed with the action of sleeping, and it\nbecame easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed. Their\nbrains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their phones, not\nwatching television, not staring at the clock—was the only action that\nhappened in that room.\nThe power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can\nbe easier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle\ntriggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a\nnew place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of\nyour room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.\nIt is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build\na new habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to\nbed early if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be\nhard to study in the living room without getting distracted if that’s\nwhere you always play video games. But when you step outside your\nnormal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You\naren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to\nform without interruption.\nWant to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop\npatio, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the\nspace where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your\ncurrent thought patterns.\nTrying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your\nregular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it easier to\navoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn’t automatically know\nwhere it is located in the store.\nWhen you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment,\nredefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for\nwork, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find\nuseful is “One space, one use.”\nWhen I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often work\nfrom my couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very\ndifficult to stop working. There was no clear division between the end\nof work time and the beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table\nmy office or the space where I ate meals? Was the couch where I\nrelaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the same\nplace.\nA few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a\nseparate room for my office. Suddenly, work was something that\nhappened “in here” and personal life was something that happened\n“out there.” It was easier for me to turn off the professional side of my\nbrain when there was a clear dividing line between work life and home\nlife. Each room had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking. The\noffice was for working.\nWhenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with\nanother. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—\nand the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why the\nversatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness.\nYou can use your phone for all sorts of tasks, which makes it a\npowerful device. But when you can use your phone to do nearly\nanything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to be\nproductive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social media, check\nemail, and play video games whenever you open your phone. It’s a\nmishmash of cues.\nYou may be thinking, “You don’t understand. I live in New York\nCity. My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to\nplay multiple roles.” Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide your\nroom into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table\nfor eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a\nwriter who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for\nreading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit\nshould have a home.\nIf you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will\nbecome associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits\nthrive under predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes\nautomatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is\neasier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes\nquickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If you\nwant behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an\nenvironment that is stable and predictable.\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is\nan environment where habits can easily form.\nChapter Summary\nSmall changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior\nover time.\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues\nthat stand out.\nMake the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.\nGradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger\nbut with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context\nbecomes the cue.\nIt is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you\nare not fighting against old cues.\nI\n7\nThe Secret to Self-Control\nN 1971, as the Vietnam War was heading into its sixteenth year,\ncongressmen Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy\nfrom Illinois made a discovery that stunned the American public.\nWhile visiting the troops, they had learned that over 15 percent of U.S.\nsoldiers stationed there were heroin addicts. Follow-up research\nrevealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had tried\nheroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted—the problem was\neven worse than they had initially thought.\nThe discovery led to a flurry of activity in Washington, including the\ncreation of the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention under\nPresident Nixon to promote prevention and rehabilitation and to track\naddicted service members when they returned home.\nLee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that\ncompletely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins\nfound that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home,\nonly 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12\npercent relapsed within three years. In other words, approximately\nnine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam eliminated their\naddiction nearly overnight.\nThis finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which\nconsidered heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible\ncondition. Instead, Robins revealed that addictions could\nspontaneously dissolve if there was a radical change in the\nenvironment. In Vietnam, soldiers spent all day surrounded by cues\ntriggering heroin use: it was easy to access, they were engulfed by the\nconstant stress of war, they built friendships with fellow soldiers who\nwere also heroin users, and they were thousands of miles from home.\nOnce a soldier returned to the United States, though, he found himself\nin an environment devoid of those triggers. When the context changed,\nso did the habit.\nCompare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone\nbecomes addicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get clean\n—which is devoid of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their\nhabit—then returns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous\ncues that caused them to get addicted in the first place. It’s no wonder\nthat usually you see numbers that are the exact opposite of those in the\nVietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users become re-\naddicted once they return home from rehab.\nThe Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs\nabout bad habits because it challenged the conventional association of\nunhealthy behavior as a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a\nsmoker, or an addict, you’ve been told your entire life that it is because\nyou lack self-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea\nthat a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply\nembedded in our culture.\nRecent research, however, shows something different. When\nscientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control,\nit turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who\nare struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring\ntheir lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-\ncontrol. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.\nThe people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need\nto use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t\nhave to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are\nessential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by\nwishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more\ndisciplined environment.\nThis counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you\nunderstand what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit\nthat has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the\nrelevant situation arises. When Patty Olwell, a therapist from Austin,\nTexas, started smoking, she would often light up while riding horses\nwith a friend. Eventually, she quit smoking and avoided it for years.\nShe had also stopped riding. Decades later, she hopped on a horse\nagain and found herself craving a cigarette for the first time in forever.\nThe cues were still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them\nin a long time.\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the\nenvironmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior change\ntechniques can backfire. Shaming obese people with weight-loss\npresentations can make them feel stressed, and as a result many\npeople return to their favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showing\npictures of blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of\nanxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. If you’re not\ncareful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop.\nBad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the\nfeelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because\nyou eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel\nsluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the\nenergy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel\nanxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes\nyour health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a\ndownward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.\nResearchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an\nexternal trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit.\nOnce you notice something, you begin to want it. This process is\nhappening all the time—often without us realizing it. Scientists have\nfound that showing addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three\nmilliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the brain and sparks\ndesire. This speed is too fast for the brain to consciously register—the\naddicts couldn’t even tell you what they had seen—but they craved the\ndrug all the same.\nHere’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to\nforget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your\nbrain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go\nunused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting\ntemptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen\nattitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In\nthe short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-\nrun, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it\nbluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits\nin a negative environment.\nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One\nof the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce\nexposure to the cue that causes it.\nIf you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in\nanother room for a few hours.\nIf you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following\nsocial media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.\nIf you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV\nout of the bedroom.\nIf you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading\nreviews of the latest tech gear.\nIf you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and\nput it in a closet after each use.\nThis practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change.\nRather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. I’m often\nsurprised by how effective simple changes like these can be. Remove a\nsingle cue and the entire habit often fades away.\nSelf-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may\nbe able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can\nmuster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of\nsummoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right\nthing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.\nThis is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits\nobvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it\ninvisible.\nOnce a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.\nPeople with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting\nsituations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.\nOne of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to\nreduce exposure to the cue that causes it.\nSelf-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.\nHOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Make It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard.

Tinbergen—who eventually won a Nobel Prize for his\nwork—was investigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds often\nseen flying along the seashores of North America.\nAdult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak, and\nTinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks would peck this spot\nwhenever they wanted food. To begin one experiment, he created a\ncollection of fake cardboard beaks, just a head without a body. When\nthe parents had flown away, he went over to the nest and offered these\ndummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes, and he\nassumed the baby birds would reject them altogether.\nHowever, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboard\nbeak, they pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother.\nThey had a clear preference for those red spots—as if they had been\ngenetically programmed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the\nbigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked. Eventually, he created\na beak with three large red dots on it. When he placed it over the nest,\nthe baby birds went crazy with delight. They pecked at the little red\npatches as if it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.\nTinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other\nanimals. For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird.\nOccasionally, as the mother moves around on the nest, one of the eggs\nwill roll out and settle on the grass nearby. Whenever this happens, the\ngoose will waddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it\nback into the nest.\nTinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round\nobject, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The\nbigger the object, the greater their response. One goose even made a\ntremendous effort to roll a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby\ngulls automatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was following\nan instinctive rule: When I see a round object nearby, I must roll it\nback into the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I should try\nto get it.\nIt’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for\nbehavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule,\nit lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated\ncues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened\nversion of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a\nvolleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.\nHumans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality.\nJunk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After\nspending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for\nfood in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on\nsalt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were\nquite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah.\nWhen you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as\nmuch as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.\nToday, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is\nabundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing\na high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our\nhealth, but the craving persists because the brain’s reward centers have\nnot changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food\nindustry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their\nevolutionary purpose.\nA primary goal of food science is to create products that are more\nattractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or jar has\nbeen enhanced in some way, if only with additional flavoring.\nCompanies spend millions of dollars to discover the most satisfying\nlevel of crunch in a potato chip or the perfect amount of fizz in a soda.\nEntire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in\nyour mouth—a quality known as orosensation. French fries, for\nexample, are a potent combination—golden brown and crunchy on the\noutside, light and smooth on the inside.\nOther processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to\nitems with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy.\nImagine the gooeyness of melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust,\nor the crunch of an Oreo cookie combined with its smooth center. With\nnatural, unprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same\nsensations over and over—how’s that seventeenth bite of kale taste?\nAfter a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel full.\nBut foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel\nand interesting, encouraging you to eat more.\nUltimately, such strategies enable food scientists to find the “bliss\npoint” for each product—the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat\nthat excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more. The\nresult, of course, is that you overeat because hyperpalatable foods are\nmore attractive to the human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a\nneuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and obesity, says,\n“We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”\nThe modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has\nspawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change:\nMake it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more\nlikely it is to become habit-forming.\nLook around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of\nreality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in.\nStores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell\nclothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes\nthan we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn splices\ntogether stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible to\nreplicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a combination of\nideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the\nmodel doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the\nsupernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features\nthat are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result,\ndriving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn\nhabits, eating habits, and many others.\nIf history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be\nmore attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to become\nmore concentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a\nmore concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a\nmore concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a more\nconcentrated form of play than board games. Compared to nature,\nthese pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the\nbrains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you\nneed to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law,\nour goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not\npossible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can\nmake any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by\nunderstanding what a craving is and how it works.\nWe begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—\nthe dopamine spike.\nTHE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP\nScientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring\na neurotransmitter called dopamine.* The importance of dopamine\nbecame apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and\nPeter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurological\nprocesses behind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the\nbrains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the\nsurprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldn’t eat.\nThey wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few days,\nthe animals died of thirst.\nIn follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-\nreleasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets\nof sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat\nfaces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even\nthough dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as\nbefore; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience\npleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without\ndesire, action stopped.\nWhen other researchers reversed this process and flooded the\nreward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits\nat breakneck speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of\ndopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes,\nthe mice developed a craving so strong they began poking their nose\ninto the box eight hundred times per hour. (Humans are not so\ndifferent: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six\nhundred times per hour.)\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is\nhighly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video\ngames, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of\ndopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors\nlike eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.\nFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but\nnow we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes,\nincluding motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion,\nand voluntary movement.\nWhen it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is\nreleased not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you\nanticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before\nthey place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of\ndopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever\nyou predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of\ndopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does\nyour motivation to act.\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets\nus to take action.\nInterestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when\nyou receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you\nanticipate a reward. This is one reason the anticipation of an\nexperience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child,\nthinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the\ngifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be\nmore enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this\nas the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”\nTHE DOPAMINE SPIKE\nFIGURE 9: Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released when the\nreward is experienced for the first time. The next time around (B), dopamine\nrises before taking action, immediately after a cue is recognized. This spike\nleads to a feeling of desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue is\nspotted. Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is\nexperienced because you already expect the reward. However, if you see a\ncue and expect a reward, but do not get one, then dopamine will drop in\ndisappointment (C). The sensitivity of the dopamine response can clearly be\nseen when a reward is provided late (D). First, the cue is identified and\ndopamine rises as a craving builds. Next, a response is taken but the reward\ndoes not come as quickly as expected and dopamine begins to drop. Finally,\nwhen the reward comes a little later than you had hoped, dopamine spikes\nagain. It is as if the brain is saying, “See! I knew I was right. Don’t forget to\nrepeat this action next time.”\nYour brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting\nrewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are\nlarge: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental\narea, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal\ncortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much\nsmaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are\ndistributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance,\nresearchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is\nactivated during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure\nis activated during liking.\nThe fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the\nregions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of\nthe crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives\nbehavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that\nprecedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.\nThese insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior\nChange. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the\nexpectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the\nfirst place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling\ncomes into play.\nHOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS\nMORE ATTRACTIVE\nRonan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland,\nenjoyed watching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercise\nmore often than he did. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrne\nhacked his stationary bike and connected it to his laptop and\ntelevision. Then he wrote a computer program that would allow Netflix\nto run only if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for\ntoo long, whatever show he was watching would pause until he started\npedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan, “eliminating obesity\none Netflix binge at a time.”\nHe was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercise\nhabit more attractive. Temptation bundling works by linking an action\nyou want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he\nbundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his\nstationary bike (the thing he needed to do).\nBusinesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when\nthe American Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC,\nlaunched its Thursday-night television lineup for the 2014–2015\nseason, they promoted temptation bundling on a massive scale.\nEvery Thursday, the company would air three shows created by\nscreenwriter Shonda Rhimes—Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to\nGet Away with Murder. They branded it as “TGIT on ABC” (TGIT\nstands for Thank God It’s Thursday). In addition to promoting the\nshows, ABC encouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and\nenjoy the evening.\nAndrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea\nbehind the campaign: “We see Thursday night as a viewership\nopportunity, with either couples or women by themselves who want to\nsit down and escape and have fun and drink their red wine and have\nsome popcorn.” The brilliance of this strategy is that ABC was\nassociating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their shows)\nwith activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine,\nand eat popcorn).\nOver time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling\nrelaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8\np.m. every Thursday, then eventually “8 p.m. on Thursday” means\nrelaxation and entertainment. The reward gets associated with the cue,\nand the habit of turning on the television becomes more attractive.\nYou’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one\nof your favorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear\nabout the latest celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using\ntemptation bundling, you could only read the tabloids and watch\nreality shows at the gym. Maybe you want to get a pedicure, but you\nneed to clean out your email inbox. Solution: only get a pedicure while\nprocessing overdue work emails.\nTemptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory\nknown as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor\nDavid Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will\nreinforce less probable behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t\nreally want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned\nto do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along\nthe way.\nYou can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking\nstrategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your\nbehavior.\nThe habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:\n1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].\n2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].\nIf you want to read the news, but you need to express more\ngratitude:\n1. After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful\nfor that happened yesterday (need).\n2. After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).\nIf you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls:\n1. After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three potential\nclients (need).\n2. After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).\nIf you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more:\n1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).\n2. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).\nThe hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling three\nclients or doing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest\nsports news or check Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do means\nyou get to do the thing you want to do.\nWe began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are\nheightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action.\nTemptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any\nhabit by connecting it with something you already want. Engineering a\ntruly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be\nemployed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be\notherwise.\nChapter Summary\nThe 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.\nThe more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to\nbecome habit-forming.\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine\nrises, so does our motivation to act.\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that\ngets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the\ndopamine spike.\nTemptation bundling is one way to make your habits more\nattractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an\naction you need to do.\nI\n9\nThe Role of Family and Friends in Shaping\nYour Habits\nN 1965, a Hungarian man named Laszlo Polgar wrote a series of\nstrange letters to a woman named Klara.\nLaszlo was a firm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all he\nbelieved in: he completely rejected the idea of innate talent. He\nclaimed that with deliberate practice and the development of good\nhabits, a child could become a genius in any field. His mantra was “A\ngenius is not born, but is educated and trained.”\nLaszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with\nhis own children—and he was writing to Klara because he “needed a\nwife willing to jump on board.” Klara was a teacher and, although she\nmay not have been as adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with\nproper instruction, anyone could advance their skills.\nLaszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment,\nand he laid out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies.\nThe kids would be home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The\nhouse would be filled with chess books and pictures of famous chess\nplayers. The children would play against each other constantly and\ncompete in the best tournaments they could find. The family would\nkeep a meticulous file system of the tournament history of every\ncompetitor the children faced. Their lives would be dedicated to chess.\nLaszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the\nPolgars were parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit.\nSusan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old.\nWithin six months, she was defeating adults.\nSofia, the middle child, did even better. By fourteen, she was a world\nchampion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster.\nJudit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat\nher father. At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among\nthe top one hundred chess players in the world. At fifteen years and\nfour months old, she became the youngest grandmaster of all time—\nyounger than Bobby Fischer, the previous record holder. For twenty-\nseven years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess player in\nthe world.\nThe childhood of the Polgar sisters was atypical, to say the least.\nAnd yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle was\nattractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the sisters talk about their\nchildhood as entertaining rather than grueling. They loved playing\nchess. They couldn’t get enough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found\nSofia playing chess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.\nEncouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Sofia, leave the pieces\nalone!” To which she replied, “Daddy, they won’t leave me alone!”\nThe Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above\nall else—praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an\nobsession with chess was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever\nhabits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive\nbehaviors you’ll find.\nTHE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS\nHumans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and\nto earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are\nessential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our\nancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse,\nbeing cast out—was a death sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the pack\nsurvives.”*\nMeanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed\nincreased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As\nCharles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who\nlearned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.”\nAs a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this\nancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern\nbehavior.\nWe don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the\nscript handed down by our friends and family, our church or school,\nour local community and society at large. Each of these cultures and\ngroups comes with its own set of expectations and standards—when\nand whether to get married, how many children to have, which\nholidays to celebrate, how much money to spend on your child’s\nbirthday party. In many ways, these social norms are the invisible rules\nthat guide your behavior each day. You’re always keeping them in\nmind, even if they are at the not top of your mind. Often, you follow the\nhabits of your culture without thinking, without questioning, and\nsometimes without remembering. As the French philosopher Michel\nde Montaigne wrote, “The customs and practices of life in society\nsweep us along.”\nMost of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a\nburden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that\nrewards you for your chess skills, playing chess will seem like a very\nattractive thing to do. If you work in a job where everyone wears\nexpensive suits, then you’ll be inclined to splurge on one as well. If all\nof your friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new phrase, you’ll\nwant to do it, too, so they know that you “get it.” Behaviors are\nattractive when they help us fit in.\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\n1. The close.\n2. The many.\n3. The powerful.\nEach group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of\nBehavior Change and make our habits more attractive.\n1. Imitating the Close\nProximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of the\nphysical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true\nof the social environment.\nWe pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our\nparents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another,\nthe way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you\ngive it a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that\nthe door is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.\nI find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me without\nrealizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically assume the body posture\nof the other person. In college, I began to talk like my roommates.\nWhen traveling to other countries, I unconsciously imitate the local\naccent despite reminding myself to stop.\nAs a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we\nare to imitate some of their habits. One groundbreaking study tracked\ntwelve thousand people for thirty-two years and found that “a person’s\nchances of becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a\nfriend who became obese.” It works the other way, too. Another study\nfound that if one person in a relationship lost weight, the other partner\nwould also slim down about one third of the time. Our friends and\nfamily provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their\ndirection.\nOf course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad\ninfluences. When astronaut Mike Massimino was a graduate student at\nMIT, he took a small robotics class. Of the ten people in the class, four\nbecame astronauts. If your goal was to make it into space, then that\nroom was about the best culture you could ask for. Similarly, one study\nfound that the higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or twelve, the\nhigher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after controlling for\nnatural levels of intelligence. We soak up the qualities and practices of\nthose around us.\nOne of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is\nto join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.\nNew habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every\nday. If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider\nworking out to be a common habit. If you’re surrounded by jazz lovers,\nyou’re more likely to believe it’s reasonable to play jazz every day. Your\nculture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself\nwith people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise\ntogether.\nTo make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy\none step further.\nJoin a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal\nbehavior and (2) you already have something in common with the\ngroup. Steve Kamb, an entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company\ncalled Nerd Fitness, which “helps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose\nweight, get strong, and get healthy.” His clients include video game\nlovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who want to get in shape.\nMany people feel out of place the first time they go to the gym or try to\nchange their diet, but if you are already similar to the other members\nof the group in some way—say, your mutual love of Star Wars—change\nbecomes more appealing because it feels like something people like\nyou already do.\nNothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It\ntransforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on\nyour own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a\nmusician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a\ncycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you.\nGrowth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers.\nWe are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to\nreinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group\nafter achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s\nfriendship and community that embed a new identity and help\nbehaviors last over the long run.\n2. Imitating the Many\nIn the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a series of\nexperiments that are now taught to legions of undergrads each year. To\nbegin each experiment, the subject entered the room with a group of\nstrangers. Unbeknownst to them, the other participants were actors\nplanted by the researcher and instructed to deliver scripted answers to\ncertain questions.\nThe group would be shown one card with a line on it and then a\nsecond card with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select the\nline on the second card that was similar in length to the line on the first\ncard. It was a very simple task. Here is an example of two cards used in\nthe experiment:\nCONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS\nFIGURE 10: This is a representation of two cards used by Solomon Asch in\nhis famous social conformity experiments. The length of the line on the first\ncard (left) is obviously the same as line C, but when a group of actors\nclaimed it was a different length the research subjects would often change\ntheir minds and go with the crowd rather than believe their own eyes.\nThe experiment always began the same. First, there would be some\neasy trials where everyone agreed on the correct line. After a few\nrounds, the participants were shown a test that was just as obvious as\nthe previous ones, except the actors in the room would select an\nintentionally incorrect answer. For example, they would respond “A”\nto the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree that the\nlines were the same even though they were clearly different.\nThe subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediately\nbecome bewildered. Their eyes would open wide. They would laugh\nnervously to themselves. They would double-check the reactions of\nother participants. Their agitation would grow as one person after\nanother delivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the subject began\nto doubt their own eyes. Eventually, they delivered the answer they\nknew in their heart to be incorrect.\nAsch ran this experiment many times and in many different ways.\nWhat he discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did\nthe conformity of the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor,\nthen there was no effect on the person’s choice. They just assumed they\nwere in the room with a dummy. When two actors were in the room\nwith the subject, there was still little impact. But as the number of\npeople increased to three actors and four and all the way to eight, the\nsubject became more likely to second-guess themselves. By the end of\nthe experiment, nearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with the\ngroup answer even though it was obviously incorrect.\nWhenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide\nour behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and\nwondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on\nAmazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best”\nbuying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is\nevidence in numbers.\nBut there can be a downside.\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired\nbehavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a\nchimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of\none group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective\nstrategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to\nblend in with the rest of the chimps.\nHumans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure to\ncomply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is\noften greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart,\nor finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than\nbe right by ourselves.\nThe human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to\nget along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it—\nyou can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people\nthink—but it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture\nrequires extra effort.\nWhen changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is\nunattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the\ntribe, change is very attractive.\n3. Imitating the Powerful\nHumans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We want pins\nand medallions on our jackets. We want President or Partner in our\ntitles. We want to be acknowledged, recognized, and praised. This\ntendency can seem vain, but overall, it’s a smart move. Historically, a\nperson with greater power and status has access to more resources,\nworries less about survival, and proves to be a more attractive mate.\nWe are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval,\nadmiration, and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do\nmuscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord\nprogressions or the parent with the most accomplished children\nbecause these things separate us from the crowd. Once we fit in, we\nstart looking for ways to stand out.\nThis is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly\neffective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people\nbecause we desire success ourselves. Many of our daily habits are\nimitations of people we admire. You replicate the marketing strategies\nof the most successful firms in your industry. You make a recipe from\nyour favorite baker. You borrow the storytelling strategies of your\nfavorite writer. You mimic the communication style of your boss. We\nimitate people we envy.\nHigh-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others.\nAnd that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise,\nwe find it attractive.\nWe are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our\nstatus. We trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’t want\nto be the slob of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit,\nwe clean up the house because we don’t want to be judged. We are\ncontinually wondering “What will others think of me?” and altering\nour behavior based on the answer.\nThe Polgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginning\nof this chapter—are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact social\ninfluences can have on our behavior. The sisters practiced chess for\nmany hours each day and continued this remarkable effort for decades.\nBut these habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness, in part,\nbecause they were valued by their culture. From the praise of their\nparents to the achievement of different status markers like becoming a\ngrandmaster, they had many reasons to continue their effort.\nChapter Summary\nThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive\nto us.\nWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our\nculture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the\ntribe.\nWe tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close\n(family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those\nwith status and prestige).\nOne of the most effective things you can do to build better habits\nis to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal\nbehavior and (2) you already have something in common with the\ngroup.\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired\nbehavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with\nthe crowd than be right by ourselves.\nIf a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it\nattractive.\nI\n10\nHow to Find and Fix the Causes of Your\nBad Habits\nN LATE 2012, I was sitting in an old apartment just a few blocks from\nIstanbul’s most famous street, Istiklal Caddesi. I was in the middle of\na four-day trip to Turkey and my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a worn-\nout armchair a few feet away.\nMike wasn’t really a guide. He was just a guy from Maine who had\nbeen living in Turkey for five years, but he offered to show me around\nwhile I was visiting the country and I took him up on it. On this\nparticular night, I had been invited to dinner with him and a handful of\nhis Turkish friends.\nThere were seven of us, and I was the only one who hadn’t, at some\npoint, smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day. I asked one of the\nTurks how he got started. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with your\nfriends. One friend smokes, then you try it.”\nWhat was truly fascinating was that half of the people in the room\nhad managed to quit smoking. Mike had been smoke-free for a few\nyears at that point, and he swore up and down that he broke the habit\nbecause of a book called Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking.\n“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he said. “It tells\nyou: ‘Stop lying to yourself. You know you don’t actually want to\nsmoke. You know you don’t really enjoy this.’ It helps you feel like\nyou’re not the victim anymore. You start to realize that you don’t need\nto smoke.”\nI had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the book afterward\nout of curiosity. The author employs an interesting strategy to help\nsmokers eliminate their cravings. He systematically reframes each cue\nassociated with smoking and gives it a new meaning.\nHe says things like:\nYou think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting\nanything because cigarettes do nothing for you.\nYou think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but\nit’s not. You can be social without smoking at all.\nYou think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking\ndoes not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.\nOver and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get\nit clearly into your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are\nmaking marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money\nbut also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of\nall, in the length and quality of your future life.”\nBy the time you get to the end of the book, smoking seems like the\nmost ridiculous thing in the world to do. And if you no longer expect\nsmoking to bring you any benefits, you have no reason to smoke. It is\nan inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: make it unattractive.\nNow, I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just change your\nmind and you can quit smoking. But stick with me for a minute.\nWHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying\nmotive. I often have a craving that goes something like this: “I want to\neat tacos.” If you were to ask me why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t\nsay, “Because I need food to survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep\ndown, I am motivated to eat tacos because I have to eat to survive. The\nunderlying motive is to obtain food and water even if my specific\ncraving is for a taco.\nSome of our underlying motives include:*\nConserve energy\nObtain food and water\nFind love and reproduce\nConnect and bond with others\nWin social acceptance and approval\nReduce uncertainty\nAchieve status and prestige\nA craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying\nmotive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or\nto check Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply\nwant to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social\nacceptance and approval, or to achieve status.\nLook at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that\nit does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the\nunderlying motives of human nature.\nFind love and reproduce = using Tinder\nConnect and bond with others = browsing Facebook\nWin social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram\nReduce uncertainty = searching on Google\nAchieve status and prestige = playing video games\nYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New\nversions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior\nremain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the\nperiod of history.\nHere’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address\nthe same underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress\nby smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by\ngoing for a run. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to\nsolve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to\nuse. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve,\nyou keep coming back to it.\nHabits are all about associations. These associations determine\nwhether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered\nin our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing\ninformation and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you\nperceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction\nabout what to do in the next moment.\nCue: You notice that the stove is hot.\nPrediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.\nCue: You see that the traffic light turned green.\nPrediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the\nintersection and get closer to my destination, so I should step on the\ngas.\nYou see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine\nthe appropriate response.\nThis all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role in your\nhabits because every action is preceded by a prediction. Life feels\nreactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your\nbest guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has\nworked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will\nhappen in the next moment.\nOur behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. Put another\nway, our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events\nthat happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events\nthemselves. Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels\nthe urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same\ncue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your\nprediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that\nprecedes them.\nThese predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically\ndescribe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions\ntransform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a\nsignal that we can apply. They help explain what we are currently\nsensing. For instance, whether or not you realize it, you are noticing\nhow warm or cold you feel right now. If the temperature drops by one\ndegree, you probably won’t do anything. If the temperature drops ten\ndegrees, however, you’ll feel cold and put on another layer of clothing.\nFeeling cold was the signal that prompted you to act. You have been\nsensing the cues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that\nyou would be better off in a different state that you take action.\nA craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to\nchange your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap\nbetween what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be\nsensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state\nprovides a reason to act.\nDesire is the difference between where you are now and where you\nwant to be in the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the\nmotivation to feel differently than you do in the moment. When you\nbinge-eat or light up or browse social media, what you really want is\nnot a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really\nwant is to feel different.\nOur feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our\ncurrent state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course\nof action. Neurologists have discovered that when emotions and\nfeelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions.\nWe have no signal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the\nneuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows\nyou to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”\nTo summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform\nare really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives.\nWhenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a\ncraving to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social\nmedia will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you\nto forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with\npositive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather\nthan to our detriment.\nHOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS\nYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate\nthem with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight\nmind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to\ndo in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to\nmake another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for\nyour family.\nNow, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You\n“get” to.\nYou get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales\ncall for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By\nsimply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You\ntransition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into\nopportunities.\nThe key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to\ndo those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for\nwhatever mind-set we choose.\nI once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When\nasked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined\nto my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I\nwould be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in\nperspective completely transformed how he lived each day.\nReframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their\ndrawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and\nmake a habit seem more attractive.\nExercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging\ntask that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily\nview it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling\nyourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build\nendurance and get fast.”\nFinance. Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However,\nyou can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize\none simple truth: living below your current means increases your\nfuture means. The money you save this month increases your\npurchasing power next month.\nMeditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three\nseconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next distraction\ninevitably pops into your mind. You can transform frustration into\ndelight when you realize that each interruption gives you a chance to\npractice returning to your breath. Distraction is a good thing because\nyou need distractions to practice meditation.\nPregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big\npresentation or competing in an important event. They experience\nquicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we\ninterpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense\nup. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with\nfluidity and grace. You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited\nand I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”\nThese little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can help change\nthe feelings you associate with a particular habit or situation.\nIf you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation\nritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you\nenjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of\nmotivation. For instance, if you always play the same song before\nhaving sex, then you’ll begin to link the music with the act. Whenever\nyou want to get in the mood, just press play.\nEd Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from a\nsimilar strategy without knowing it. “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My\nfocus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on]\nwhile writing. I don’t even have to play any music.” Without realizing\nit, he was conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his\nheadphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did focused work.\nAfter doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones on\nbecame a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus.\nThe craving followed naturally.\nAthletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the mind-set to\nperform. During my baseball career, I developed a specific ritual of\nstretching and throwing before each game. The whole sequence took\nabout ten minutes, and I did it the same way every single time. While it\nphysically warmed me up to play, more importantly, it put me in the\nright mental state. I began to associate my pregame ritual with feeling\ncompetitive and focused. Even if I wasn’t motivated beforehand, by the\ntime I was done with my ritual, I was in “game mode.”\nYou can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to\nfeel happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—\nlike petting your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short\nroutine that you perform every time before you do the thing you love.\nMaybe you take three deep breaths and smile.\nThree deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat.\nEventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine\nwith being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy.\nOnce established, you can break it out anytime you need to change\nyour emotional state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and\nsmile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has\nbeen built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do with\nthe original situation.\nThe key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to\nreframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you\ncan reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into\nan attractive one.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it\nunattractive.\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper\nunderlying motive.\nYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.\nThe cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes\nthem. The prediction leads to a feeling.\nHighlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem\nunattractive.\nHabits are attractive when we associate them with positive\nfeelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative\nfeelings.

They would be graded solely on the amount of\nwork they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the\nnumber of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos\nwould rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.\nMeanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the\n“quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their\nwork. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester,\nbut to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.\nAt the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best\nphotos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester,\nthese students were busy taking photos, experimenting with\ncomposition and lighting, testing out various methods in the\ndarkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating\nhundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality\ngroup sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had\nlittle to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one\nmediocre photo.*\nIt is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for\nchange: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build\nmuscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring\nout the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As\nVoltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”\nI refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking\naction. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When\nyou’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those\nare all good things, but they don’t produce a result.\nAction, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an\noutcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s\nmotion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I\nsearch for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s\nmotion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.\nSometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome\nby itself. It doesn’t matter how many times you go talk to the personal\ntrainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of\nworking out will get the result you’re looking to achieve.\nIf motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do\nit because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than\nnot, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making\nprogress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at\navoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be judged publicly,\nso we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And that’s the\nbiggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you\nwant to delay failure.\nIt’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you’re still\nmaking progress. You think, “I’ve got conversations going with four\npotential clients right now. This is good. We’re moving in the right\ndirection.” Or, “I brainstormed some ideas for that book I want to\nwrite. This is coming together.”\nMotion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really,\nyou’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation\nbecomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You\ndon’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.\nIf you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not\nperfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You\njust need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you\njust need to get your reps in.\nHOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?\nHabit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes\nprogressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat\nan activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become\nefficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long-term\npotentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between\nneurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity. With each\nrepetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural connections\ntighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949,\nthis phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that\nfire together wire together.”\nRepeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. In\nmusicians, the cerebellum—critical for physical movements like\nplucking a guitar string or pulling a violin bow—is larger than it is in\nnonmusicians. Mathematicians, meanwhile, have increased gray\nmatter in the inferior parietal lobule, which plays a key role in\ncomputation and calculation. Its size is directly correlated with the\namount of time spent in the field; the older and more experienced the\nmathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter.\nWhen scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they\nfound that the hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in spatial\nmemory—was significantly larger in their subjects than in non–taxi\ndrivers. Even more fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size\nwhen a driver retired. Like the muscles of the body responding to\nregular weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as they\nare used and atrophy as they are abandoned.\nOf course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits was\nrecognized long before neuroscientists began poking around. In 1860,\nthe English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak\na new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform\nunaccustomed movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels\nthrough which each sensation has to pass have not become\nestablished; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than\nthis difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they can\nbe performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.” Both common\nsense and scientific evidence agree: repetition is a form of change.\nEach time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular\nneural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply\nputting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to\nencoding a new habit. It is why the students who took tons of photos\nimproved their skills while those who merely theorized about perfect\nphotos did not. One group engaged in active practice, the other in\npassive learning. One in action, the other in motion.\nAll habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to\nautomatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is\nthe ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step,\nwhich occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.\nIt looks something like this:\nTHE HABIT LINE\nFIGURE 11: In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effort\nand concentration to perform. After a few repetitions (point B), it gets easier,\nbut still requires some conscious attention. With enough practice (point C),\nthe habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold\n—the habit line—the behavior can be done more or less without thinking. A\nnew habit has been formed.\nOn the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when researchers\ntrack the level of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for ten\nminutes each day. The shape of these charts, which scientists call\nlearning curves, reveals an important truth about behavior change:\nhabits form based on frequency, not time.\nWALKING 10 MINUTES PER DAY\nFIGURE 12: This graph shows someone who built the habit of walking for\nten minutes after breakfast each day. Notice that as the repetitions increase,\nso does automaticity, until the behavior is as easy and automatic as it can\nbe.\nOne of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take\nto build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How\nmany does it take to form a new habit?” That is, how many repetitions\nare required to make a habit automatic?\nThere is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit\nformation. It doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one days or thirty days\nor three hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you perform\nthe behavior. You could do something twice in thirty days, or two\nhundred times. It’s the frequency that makes the difference. Your\ncurrent habits have been internalized over the course of hundreds, if\nnot thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the same level of\nfrequency. You need to string together enough successful attempts\nuntil the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the\nHabit Line.\nIn practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for a habit to\nbecome automatic. What matters is that you take the actions you need\nto take to make progress. Whether an action is fully automatic is of less\nimportance.\nTo build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way\nto make practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior\nChange: make it easy. The chapters that follow will show you how to\ndo exactly that.\nChapter Summary\nThe 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy.\nThe most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.\nFocus on taking action, not being in motion.\nHabit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes\nprogressively more automatic through repetition.\nThe amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as\nimportant as the number of times you have performed it.\nI\n12\nThe Law of Least Effort\nN HIS AWARD-WINNING BOOK, Guns, Germs, and Steel, anthropologist\nand biologist Jared Diamond points out a simple fact: different\ncontinents have different shapes. At first glance, this statement seems\nrather obvious and unimportant, but it turns out to have a profound\nimpact on human behavior.\nThe primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is,\nthe landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin\nrather than wide and fat. The same is generally true for Africa.\nMeanwhile, the landmass that makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle\nEast is the opposite. This massive stretch of land tends to be more east-\nwest in shape. According to Diamond, this difference in shape played a\nsignificant role in the spread of agriculture over the centuries.\nWhen agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had an\neasier time expanding along east-west routes than along north-south\nones. This is because locations along the same latitude generally share\nsimilar climates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in\nseason. These factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia to\ndomesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire stretch of land\nfrom France to China.\nTHE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR\nFIGURE 13: The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east-west. The primary\naxis of the Americas and Africa is north-south. This leads to a wider range of\nclimates up-and-down the Americas than across Europe and Asia. As a\nresult, agriculture spread nearly twice as fast across Europe and Asia than it\ndid elsewhere. The behavior of farmers—even across hundreds or\nthousands of years—was constrained by the amount of friction in the\nenvironment.\nBy comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from north\nto south. Just imagine how different the weather is in Florida\ncompared to Canada. You can be the most talented farmer in the\nworld, but it won’t help you grow Florida oranges in the Canadian\nwinter. Snow is a poor substitute for soil. In order to spread crops\nalong north-south routes, farmers would need to find and domesticate\nnew plants whenever the climate changed.\nAs a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster across Asia\nand Europe than it did up and down the Americas. Over the span of\ncenturies, this small difference had a very big impact. Increased food\nproduction allowed for more rapid population growth. With more\npeople, these cultures were able to build stronger armies and were\nbetter equipped to develop new technologies. The changes started out\nsmall—a crop that spread slightly farther, a population that grew\nslightly faster—but compounded into substantial differences over time.\nThe spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd Law of\nBehavior Change on a global scale. Conventional wisdom holds that\nmotivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it,\nyou’d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy\nand to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity\nbest seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.\nEnergy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever\npossible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which\nstates that when deciding between two similar options, people will\nnaturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of\nwork.* For example, expanding your farm to the east where you can\ngrow the same crops rather than heading north where the climate is\ndifferent. Out of all the possible actions we could take, the one that is\nrealized is the one that delivers the most value for the least effort. We\nare motivated to do what is easy.\nEvery action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy\nrequired, the less likely it is to occur. If your goal is to do a hundred\npush-ups per day, that’s a lot of energy! In the beginning, when you’re\nmotivated and excited, you can muster the strength to get started. But\nafter a few days, such a massive effort feels exhausting. Meanwhile,\nsticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost no\nenergy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the more\nlikely it is to occur.\nLook at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you’ll see\nthat it can be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like\nscrolling on our phones, checking email, and watching television steal\nso much of our time because they can be performed almost without\neffort. They are remarkably convenient.\nIn a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really\nwant. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to\nfeeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t\nactually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the\nhabit delivers. The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the\nhabit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end\nstate. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do\nthem even when you don’t feel like it. If you can make your good habits\nmore convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.\nBut what about all the moments when we seem to do the opposite?\nIf we’re all so lazy, then how do you explain people accomplishing hard\nthings like raising a child or starting a business or climbing Mount\nEverest?\nCertainly, you are capable of doing very hard things. The problem is\nthat some days you feel like doing the hard work and some days you\nfeel like giving in. On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many things\nworking in your favor as possible so that you can overcome the\nchallenges life naturally throws your way. The less friction you face, the\neasier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea behind make it\neasy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as\npossible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.\nHOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT\nImagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle.\nSome water can flow through, but not very much. If you want to\nincrease the rate at which water passes through the hose, you have two\noptions. The first option is to crank up the valve and force more water\nout. The second option is to simply remove the bend in the hose and let\nwater flow through naturally.\nTrying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like\ntrying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requires\na lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making\nyour habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose.\nRather than trying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it.\nOne of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with\nyour habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we\ndiscussed environment design as a method for making cues more\nobvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actions\neasier. For example, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is\nbest to choose a place that is already along the path of your daily\nroutine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your\nlife. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work\nbecause stopping doesn’t add much friction to your lifestyle. By\ncomparison, if the gym is off the path of your normal commute—even\nby just a few blocks—now you’re going “out of your way” to get there.\nPerhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your\nhome or office. Too often, we try to start habits in high-friction\nenvironments. We try to follow a strict diet while we are out to dinner\nwith friends. We try to write a book in a chaotic household. We try to\nconcentrate while using a smartphone filled with distractions. It\ndoesn’t have to be this way. We can remove the points of friction that\nhold us back. This is precisely what electronics manufacturers in Japan\nbegan to do in the 1970s.\nIn an article published in the New Yorker titled “Better All the\nTime,” James Suroweicki writes:\n“Japanese firms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean\nproduction,’ relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the\nproduction process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workers\ndidn’t have to waste time twisting and turning to reach their tools. The\nresult was that Japanese factories were more efficient and Japanese\nproducts were more reliable than American ones. In 1974, service calls\nfor American-made color televisions were five times as common as for\nJapanese televisions. By 1979, it took American workers three times as\nlong to assemble their sets.”\nI like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.* The\nJapanese companies looked for every point of friction in the\nmanufacturing process and eliminated it. As they subtracted wasted\neffort, they added customers and revenue. Similarly, when we remove\nthe points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve\nmore with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good:\nwe are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the cognitive\nload our environment places on us.)\nIf you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that\none of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits\nof friction from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of\nshopping for groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making\nsocial introductions. Ride-sharing services reduce the friction of\ngetting across town. Text messaging reduces the friction of sending a\nletter in the mail.\nLike a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their\nworkspace to reduce wasted motion, successful companies design their\nproducts to automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible.\nThey reduce the number of fields on each form. They pare down the\nnumber of clicks required to create an account. They deliver their\nproducts with easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers to\nmake fewer choices.\nWhen the first voice-activated speakers were released—products\nlike Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod—I asked a\nfriend what he liked about the product he had purchased. He said it\nwas just easier to say “Play some country music” than to pull out his\nphone, open the music app, and pick a playlist. Of course, just a few\nyears earlier, having unlimited access to music in your pocket was a\nremarkably frictionless behavior compared to driving to the store and\nbuying a CD. Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same\nresult in an easier fashion.\nSimilar strategies have been used effectively by governments. When\nthe British government wanted to increase tax collection rates, they\nswitched from sending citizens to a web page where the tax form could\nbe downloaded to linking directly to the form. Reducing that one step\nin the process increased the response rate from 19.2 percent to 23.4\npercent. For a country like the United Kingdom, those percentage\npoints represent millions in tax revenue.\nThe central idea is to create an environment where doing the right\nthing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits\ncomes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our\ngood habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.\nPRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE\nOswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi. He is\nalso someone who understands the power of priming his environment.\nNuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by following a strategy he\nrefers to as “resetting the room.” For instance, when he finishes\nwatching television, he places the remote back on the TV stand,\narranges the pillows on the couch, and folds the blanket. When he\nleaves his car, he throws any trash away. Whenever he takes a shower,\nhe wipes down the toilet while the shower is warming up. (As he notes,\nthe “perfect time to clean the toilet is right before you wash yourself in\nthe shower anyway.”) The purpose of resetting each room is not simply\nto clean up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action.\n“When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols\nwrote. “Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in\ngood shape. . . . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy.\nI’m just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.”\nWhenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are\npriming it to make the next action easy. For instance, my wife keeps a\nbox of greeting cards that are presorted by occasion—birthday,\nsympathy, wedding, graduation, and more. Whenever necessary, she\ngrabs an appropriate card and sends it off. She is incredibly good at\nremembering to send cards because she has reduced the friction of\ndoing so. For years, I was the opposite. Someone would have a baby\nand I would think, “I should send a card.” But then weeks would pass\nand by the time I remembered to pick one up at the store, it was too\nlate. The habit wasn’t easy.\nThere are many ways to prime your environment so it’s ready for\nimmediate use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet\non the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out any\nplates and utensils you’ll need the night before. When you wake up,\nmaking breakfast will be easy.\nWant to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and\ndrawing tools on top of your desk, within easy reach.\nWant to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag,\nand water bottle ahead of time.\nWant to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables\non weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy\naccess to healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.\nThese are simple ways to make the good habit the path of least\nresistance.\nYou can also invert this principle and prime the environment to\nmake bad behaviors difficult. If you find yourself watching too much\ntelevision, for example, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it back\nin if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch. This\nsetup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.\nIf that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further. Unplug the\ntelevision and take the batteries out of the remote after each use, so it\ntakes an extra ten seconds to turn it back on. And if you’re really hard-\ncore, move the television out of the living room and into a closet after\neach use. You can be sure you’ll only take it out when you really want\nto watch something. The greater the friction, the less likely the habit.\nWhenever possible, I leave my phone in a different room until\nlunch. When it’s right next to me, I’ll check it all morning for no reason\nat all. But when it is in another room, I rarely think about it. And the\nfriction is high enough that I won’t go get it without a reason. As a\nresult, I get three to four hours each morning when I can work without\ninterruption.\nIf sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like enough,\ntell a friend or family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask a\ncoworker to keep it at their desk in the morning and give it back to you\nat lunch.\nIt is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwanted\nbehavior. When I hide beer in the back of the fridge where I can’t see it,\nI drink less. When I delete social media apps from my phone, it can be\nweeks before I download them again and log in. These tricks are\nunlikely to curb a true addiction, but for many of us, a little bit of\nfriction can be the difference between sticking with a good habit or\nsliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative impact of making\ndozens of these changes and living in an environment designed to\nmake the good behaviors easier and the bad behaviors harder.\nWhether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a\nparent, a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same\nquestion: “How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s\nright?” Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the\nactions that are easiest to do.\nChapter Summary\nHuman behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally\ngravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of\nwork.\nCreate an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as\npossible.\nReduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction\nis low, habits are easy.\nIncrease the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction\nis high, habits are difficult.\nPrime your environment to make future actions easier.\nT\n13\nHow to Stop Procrastinating by Using the\nTwo-Minute Rule\nWYLA THARP IS widely regarded as one of the greatest dancers and\nchoreographers of the modern era. In 1992, she was awarded a\nMacArthur Fellowship, often referred to as the Genius Grant, and she\nhas spent the bulk of her career touring the globe to perform her\noriginal works. She also credits much of her success to simple daily\nhabits.\n“I begin each day of my life with a ritual,” she writes. “I wake up at\n5:30 A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweat shirt,\nand my hat. I walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell\nthe driver to take me to the Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and First\nAvenue, where I work out for two hours.\n“The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body\nthrough each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I\ntell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual.\n“It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning\nhabitualizes it—makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance\nthat I would skip it or do it differently. It is one more item in my\narsenal of routines, and one less thing to think about.”\nHailing a cab each morning may be a tiny action, but it is a splendid\nexample of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.\nResearchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any\ngiven day are done out of habit. This is already a substantial\npercentage, but the true influence of your habits is even greater than\nthese numbers suggest. Habits are automatic choices that influence the\nconscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a\nfew seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes\nor hours afterward.\nHabits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down\na path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next\nbehavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing\nthan to start doing something different. You sit through a bad movie\nfor two hours. You keep snacking even when you’re already full. You\ncheck your phone for “just a second” and soon you have spent twenty\nminutes staring at the screen. In this way, the habits you follow\nwithout thinking often determine the choices you make when you are\nthinking.\nEach evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—\nthat shapes the rest of my night. My wife walks in the door from work\nand either we change into our workout clothes and head to the gym or\nwe crash onto the couch, order Indian food, and watch The Office.*\nSimilar to Twyla Tharp hailing the cab, the ritual is changing into my\nworkout clothes. If I change clothes, I know the workout will happen.\nEverything that follows—driving to the gym, deciding which exercises\nto do, stepping under the bar—is easy once I’ve taken the first step.\nEvery day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized\nimpact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments. The moment\nyou decide between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. The moment\nyou choose between driving your car or riding your bike. The moment\nyou decide between starting your homework or grabbing the video\ngame controller. These choices are a fork in the road.\nDECISIVE MOMENTS\nFIGURE 14: The difference between a good day and a bad day is often a\nfew productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is\nlike a fork in the road, and these choices stack up throughout the day and\ncan ultimately lead to very different outcomes.\nDecisive moments set the options available to your future self. For\ninstance, walking into a restaurant is a decisive moment because it\ndetermines what you’ll be eating for lunch. Technically, you are in\ncontrol of what you order, but in a larger sense, you can only order an\nitem if it is on the menu. If you walk into a steakhouse, you can get a\nsirloin or a rib eye, but not sushi. Your options are constrained by\nwhat’s available. They are shaped by the first choice.\nWe are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering\nthe decisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is\nmade up of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that\ndetermine the path you take. These little choices stack up, each one\nsetting the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time.\nHabits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not\nthe gym.\nTHE TWO-MINUTE RULE\nEven when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big.\nWhen you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes\nover and you end up trying to do too much too soon. The most effective\nway I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule,\nwhich states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two\nminutes to do.”\nYou’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-\nminute version:\n“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”\n“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”\n“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”\n“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”\n“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”\nThe idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone\ncan meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing\naway. And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy\nbecause once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to\ncontinue doing it. A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The\nactions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should\nbe easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you\ndown a more productive path.\nYou can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your\ndesired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy”\nto “very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running\na 5K is hard. Walking ten thousand steps is moderately difficult.\nWalking ten minutes is easy. And putting on your running shoes is very\neasy. Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is\nto put on your running shoes. That’s how you follow the Two-Minute\nRule.\nVery easy\nEasy\nModerate\nHard\nVery hard\nPut on your running\nshoes\nWalk ten\nminutes\nWalk ten thousand\nsteps\nRun a 5K\nRun a\nmarathon\nWrite one sentence\nWrite one\nparagraph\nWrite one thousand\nwords\nWrite a five-thousand-\nword article\nWrite a\nbook\nOpen your notes\nStudy for ten\nminutes\nStudy for three\nhours\nGet straight A’s\nEarn a PhD\nPeople often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or\nmeditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not\nto do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The\ntruth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you\ncan’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of\nmastering the finer details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit\nfrom the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have\nto standardize before you can optimize.\nAs you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply\nbecome a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely\na hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a\ndifficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the\nmore likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus\nthat is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before\nevery workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak\nperformance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easier\nto get into the hard work of creating. By developing a consistent\npower-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time\neach night. You may not be able to automate the whole process, but\nyou can make the first action mindless. Make it easy to start and the\nrest will follow.\nThe Two-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. You\nknow that the real goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it may\nfeel like you’re trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring to\nread one page or do one push-up or open their notes. And if you know\nit’s a mental trick, why would you fall for it?\nIf the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes\nand then stop. Go for a run, but you must stop after two minutes. Start\nmeditating, but you must stop after two minutes. Study Arabic, but you\nmust stop after two minutes. It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the\nwhole thing. Your habit can only last one hundred and twenty seconds.\nOne of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred\npounds. In the beginning, he went to the gym each day, but he told\nhimself he wasn’t allowed to stay for more than five minutes. He would\ngo to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave as soon as his time\nwas up. After a few weeks, he looked around and thought, “Well, I’m\nalways coming here anyway. I might as well start staying a little\nlonger.” A few years later, the weight was gone.\nJournaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit\nfrom getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most\npeople give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling\nfeels like a chore.* The secret is to always stay below the point where it\nfeels like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the\nUnited Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically writing\nless than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed\nlike a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind\nof writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,”\nhe said.\nStrategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the\nidentity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row\n—even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new\nidentity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on\nbecoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking\nthe smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be.\nWe rarely think about change this way because everyone is\nconsumed by the end goal. But one push-up is better than not\nexercising. One minute of guitar practice is better than none at all. One\nminute of reading is better than never picking up a book. It’s better to\ndo less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.\nAt some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing\nup each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique\nwe call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate\ngoal. Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of\nthe behavior. Then, advance to an intermediate step and repeat the\nprocess—focusing on just the first two minutes and mastering that\nstage before moving on to the next level. Eventually, you’ll end up with\nthe habit you had originally hoped to build while still keeping your\nfocus where it should be: on the first two minutes of the behavior.\nEXAMPLES OF HABIT SHAPING\nBecoming an Early Riser\nPhase 1: Be home by 10 p.m. every night.\nPhase 2: Have all devices (TV, phone, etc.) turned off by 10 p.m. every night.\nPhase 3: Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night (reading a book, talking with your partner).\nPhase 4: Lights off by 10 p.m. every night.\nPhase 5: Wake up at 6 a.m. every day.\nBecoming Vegan\nPhase 1: Start eating vegetables at each meal.\nPhase 2: Stop eating animals with four legs (cow, pig, lamb, etc.).\nPhase 3: Stop eating animals with two legs (chicken, turkey, etc.).\nPhase 4: Stop eating animals with no legs (fish, clams, scallops, etc.).\nPhase 5: Stop eating all animal products (eggs, milk, cheese).\nStarting to Exercise\nPhase 1: Change into workout clothes.\nPhase 2: Step out the door (try taking a walk).\nPhase 3: Drive to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave.\nPhase 4: Exercise for fifteen minutes at least once per week.\nPhase 5: Exercise three times per week.\nNearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a two-minute\nbehavior. I want to live a healthy and long life > I need to stay in shape\n> I need to exercise > I need to change into my workout clothes. I want\nto have a happy marriage > I need to be a good partner > I should do\nsomething each day to make my partner’s life easier > I should meal\nplan for next week.\nWhenever you are struggling to stick with a habit, you can employ\nthe Two-Minute Rule. It’s a simple way to make your habits easy.\nChapter Summary\nHabits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact\nyour behavior for minutes or hours afterward.\nMany habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a\nfork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a\nproductive day or an unproductive one.\nThe Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it\nshould take less than two minutes to do.”\nThe more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely\nit becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is\nrequired to do great things.\nStandardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that\ndoesn’t exist.\nI\n14\nHow to Make Good Habits Inevitable and\nBad Habits Impossible\nN THE SUMMER OF 1830, Victor Hugo was facing an impossible deadline.\nTwelve months earlier, the French author had promised his\npublisher a new book. But instead of writing, he spent that year\npursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and delaying his work.\nFrustrated, Hugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than\nsix months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831.\nHugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He\ncollected all of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in\na large chest. He was left with nothing to wear except a large shawl.\nLacking any suitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study\nand wrote furiously during the fall and winter of 1830. The Hunchback\nof Notre Dame was published two weeks early on January 14, 1831.*\nSometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more\nabout making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of\nBehavior Change: make it difficult. If you find yourself continually\nstruggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page\nfrom Victor Hugo and make your bad habits more difficult by creating\nwhat psychologists call a commitment device.\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the present that\ncontrols your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future\nbehavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.\nWhen Victor Hugo shut his clothes away so he could focus on writing,\nhe was creating a commitment device.*\nThere are many ways to create a commitment device. You can\nreduce overeating by purchasing food in individual packages rather\nthan in bulk size. You can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list\nat casinos and online poker sites to prevent future gambling sprees.\nI’ve even heard of athletes who have to “make weight” for a\ncompetition choosing to leave their wallets at home during the week\nbefore weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to buy fast food.\nAs another example, my friend and fellow habits expert Nir Eyal\npurchased an outlet timer, which is an adapter that he plugged in\nbetween his internet router and the power outlet. At 10 p.m. each\nnight, the outlet timer cuts off the power to the router. When the\ninternet goes off, everyone knows it is time to go to bed.\nCommitment devices are useful because they enable you to take\nadvantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation.\nWhenever I’m looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the waiter\nto split my meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If I\nwaited until the meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half,” it\nwould never work.\nThe key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get\nout of the good habit than to get started on it. If you’re feeling\nmotivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of\ntime. If you’re excited about the business you want to start, email an\nentrepreneur you respect and set up a consulting call. When the time\ncomes to act, the only way to bail is to cancel the meeting, which\nrequires effort and may cost money.\nCommitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing\nin the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However,\nwe can do even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad\nhabits impossible.\nHOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT\nAGAIN\nJohn Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his\nchildhood doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his\nfather’s sawmill. After attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson\nreturned to Ohio and opened a small supply store for coal miners.\nIt seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition\nand enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make\nmoney. That was when Patterson discovered his employees were\nstealing from him.\nIn the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts\nwere kept in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded.\nThere were no video cameras to review behavior and no software to\ntrack transactions. Unless you were willing to hover over your\nemployees every minute of the day, or to manage all transactions\nyourself, it was difficult to prevent theft.\nAs Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an\nadvertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier.\nDesigned by fellow Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cash\nregister. The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts inside\nafter each transaction. Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each.\nEmployee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six\nmonths, Patterson’s business went from losing money to making\n$5,000 in profit—the equivalent of more than $100,000 today.\nPatterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed\nbusinesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s invention and opened the\nNational Cash Register Company. Ten years later, National Cash\nRegister had over one thousand employees and was on its way to\nbecoming one of the most successful businesses of its time.\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do.\nIncrease the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. The\nbrilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by\nmaking stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change\nthe employees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.\nSome actions—like installing a cash register—pay off again and\nagain. These onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but\ncreate increasing value over time. I’m fascinated by the idea that a\nsingle choice can deliver returns again and again, and I surveyed my\nreaders on their favorite onetime actions that lead to better long-term\nhabits. The table on the following page shares some of the most\npopular answers.\nI’d wager that if the average person were to simply do half of the\nonetime actions on this list—even if they didn’t give another thought to\ntheir habits—most would find themselves living a better life a year\nfrom now. These onetime actions are a straightforward way to employ\nthe 3rd Law of Behavior Change. They make it easier to sleep well, eat\nhealthy, be productive, save money, and generally live better.\nONETIME ACTIONS THAT LOCK IN GOOD HABITS\nNutrition\nBuy a water filter to clean your drinking water.\nUse smaller plates to reduce caloric intake.\nSleep\nBuy a good mattress.\nGet blackout curtains.\nRemove your television from your bedroom.\nProductivity\nUnsubscribe from emails.\nTurn off notifications and mute group chats.\nSet your phone to silent.\nUse email filters to clear up your inbox.\nDelete games and social media apps on your phone.\nHappiness\nGet a dog.\nMove to a friendly, social neighborhood.\nGeneral Health\nGet vaccinated.\nBuy good shoes to avoid back pain.\nBuy a supportive chair or standing desk.\nFinance\nEnroll in an automatic savings plan.\nSet up automatic bill pay.\nCut cable service.\nAsk service providers to lower your bills.\nOf course, there are many ways to automate good habits and\neliminate bad ones. Typically, they involve putting technology to work\nfor you. Technology can transform actions that were once hard,\nannoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and\nsimple. It is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right\nbehavior.\nThis is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too\ninfrequently to become habitual. Things you have to do monthly or\nyearly—like rebalancing your investment portfolio—are never repeated\nfrequently enough to become a habit, so they benefit in particular from\ntechnology “remembering” to do them for you.\nOther examples include:\nMedicine: Prescriptions can be automatically refilled.\nPersonal finance: Employees can save for retirement with an\nautomatic wage deduction.\nCooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery shopping.\nProductivity: Social media browsing can be cut off with a website\nblocker.\nWhen you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend\nyour effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we\nhand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to\npour into the next stage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher\nAlfred North Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending the\nnumber of operations we can perform without thinking about them.”\nOf course, the power of technology can work against us as well.\nBinge-watching becomes a habit because you have to put more effort in\nto stop looking at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of\npressing a button to advance to the next episode, Netflix or YouTube\nwill autoplay it for you. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.\nTechnology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on\nyour smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger,\nyou can have food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of\nboredom, you can get lost in the vast expanse of social media. When\nthe effort required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you\ncan find yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment.\nThe downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping\nfrom easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but\nultimately more rewarding, work.\nI often find myself gravitating toward social media during any\ndowntime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my\nphone. It’s easy to write off these minor distractions as “just taking a\nbreak,” but over time they can accumulate into a serious issue. The\nconstant tug of “just one more minute” can prevent me from doing\nanything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The average person\nspends over two hours per day on social media. What could you do\nwith an extra six hundred hours per year?)\nDuring the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new\ntime management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset\nthe passwords on all my social media accounts, which logged me out\non each device. All week I worked without distraction. On Friday, she\nwould send me the new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy\nwhat social media had to offer until Monday morning when she would\ndo it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up with a friend or\nfamily member and reset each other’s passwords each week.)\nOne of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted. Within the\nfirst week of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t\nneed to check it nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t\nneed it each day. It had simply been so easy that it had become the\ndefault. Once my bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did\nactually have the motivation to work on more meaningful tasks. After I\nremoved the mental candy from my environment, it became much\neasier to eat the healthy stuff.\nWhen working in your favor, automation can make your good habits\ninevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is the ultimate way to lock\nin future behavior rather than relying on willpower in the moment. By\nutilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and\ntechnology, you can create an environment of inevitability—a space\nwhere good habits are not just an outcome you hope for but an\noutcome that is virtually guaranteed.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it\ndifficult.\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the present that\nlocks in better behavior in the future.\nThe ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your\nhabits.\nOnetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an\nautomatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your\nfuture habits and deliver increasing returns over time.\nUsing technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and\neffective way to guarantee the right behavior.\nHOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Make It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard.

By 1998,\nover nine million people called it home. It was the economic center of\nPakistan and a transportation hub, with some of the most active\nairports and seaports in the region. In the commercial parts of town,\nyou could find all of the standard urban amenities and bustling\ndowntown streets. But Karachi was also one of the least livable cities in\nthe world.\nOver 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter settlements\nand slums. These densely packed neighborhoods were filled with\nmakeshift houses cobbled together from old boards, cinder blocks, and\nother discarded materials. There was no waste removal system, no\nelectricity grid, no clean water supply. When dry, the streets were a\ncombination of dust and trash. When wet, they became a muddy pit of\nsewage. Mosquito colonies thrived in pools of stagnant water, and\nchildren played among the garbage.\nThe unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease.\nContaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting,\nand abdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children living there were\nmalnourished. With so many people crammed into such a small space,\nviruses and bacterial infections spread rapidly. It was this public health\ncrisis that had brought Stephen Luby to Pakistan.\nLuby and his team realized that in an environment with poor\nsanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands could make a real\ndifference in the health of the residents. But they soon discovered that\nmany people were already aware that handwashing was important.\nAnd yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing their\nhands in a haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their hands\nunder the water quickly. Others would only wash one hand. Many\nwould simply forget to wash their hands before preparing food.\nEveryone said handwashing was important, but few people made a\nhabit out of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was\nconsistency.\nThat was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gamble\nto supply the neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to your\nstandard bar of soap, using Safeguard was a more enjoyable\nexperience.\n“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told me. “The\nstudy participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.” The\nsoap foamed easily, and people were able to lather their hands with\nsuds. It smelled great. Instantly, handwashing became slightly more\npleasurable.\n“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change\nbut as habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a lot easier for people to adopt\na product that provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example\nthe mint taste of toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not\nprovide pleasurable sensory feedback, like flossing one’s teeth. The\nmarketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to create a\npositive handwashing experience.”\nWithin months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health of\nchildren in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent;\npneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by\n35 percent.\nThe long-term effects were even better. “We went back to some of\nthe households in Karachi six years after,” Luby told me. “Over 95\npercent of households who had been given the soap for free and\nencouraged to wash their hands had a handwashing station with soap\nand water available when our study team visited. . . . We had not given\nany soap to the intervention group for over five years, but during the\ntrial they had become so habituated to wash their hands, that they had\nmaintained the practice.” It was a powerful example of the fourth and\nfinal Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying.\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is\nsatisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor\nones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers\nwell—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again,\nnext time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth\nremembering and repeating.\nTake the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold\ncommercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until Wrigley\nlaunched in 1891 that it became a worldwide habit. Early versions were\nmade from relatively bland resins—chewy, but not tasty. Wrigley\nrevolutionized the industry by adding flavors like Spearmint and Juicy\nFruit, which made the product flavorful and fun to use. Then they went\na step further and began pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a clean\nmouth. Advertisements told readers to “Refresh Your Taste.”\nTasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of\nimmediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use.\nConsumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the largest chewing\ngum company in the world.\nToothpaste had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed great\nsuccess when they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and\ncinnamon to their products. These flavors don’t improve the\neffectiveness of toothpaste. They simply create a “clean mouth” feel\nand make the experience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My\nwife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didn’t like the\naftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint flavor, which\nproved to be more satisfying.\nConversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to\nrepeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had\na narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less\ntime with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible\nwhenever he was around. Within a few encounters, he started avoiding\nher because he found her so uninteresting.\nStories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior\nChange: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.\nYou learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded\nfor doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions\ncultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.\nThe first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it\nattractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be\nperformed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it\nsatisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next\ntime. It completes the habit loop.\nBut there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of\nsatisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.\nTHE MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED\nREWARDS\nImagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of Africa—a giraffe or an\nelephant or a lion. On any given day, most of your decisions have an\nimmediate impact. You are always thinking about what to eat or where\nto sleep or how to avoid a predator. You are constantly focused on the\npresent or the very near future. You live in what scientists call an\nimmediate-return environment because your actions instantly deliver\nclear and immediate outcomes.\nNow switch back to your human self. In modern society, many of\nthe choices you make today will not benefit you immediately. If you do\na good job at work, you’ll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise\ntoday, perhaps you won’t be overweight next year. If you save money\nnow, maybe you’ll have enough for retirement decades from now. You\nlive in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you\ncan work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.\nThe human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return\nenvironment. The earliest remains of modern humans, known as\nHomo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years\nold. These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to\nours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the\nregion responsible for higher functions like language—was roughly the\nsame size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking\naround with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.\nIt is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that\nsociety has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.*\nCompared to the age of the brain, modern society is brand-new. In the\nlast one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane,\nthe television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone,\nand Beyoncé. The world has changed much in recent years, but human\nnature has changed little.\nSimilar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestors\nspent their days responding to grave threats, securing the next meal,\nand taking shelter from a storm. It made sense to place a high value on\ninstant gratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And after\nthousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, our\nbrains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.\nBehavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency.\nThat is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across\ntime.* You value the present more than the future. Usually, this\ntendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typically\nworth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But\noccasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.\nWhy would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung\ncancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their\nrisk of obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it\ncan result in sexually transmitted disease? Once you understand how\nthe brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the\nconsequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are\nimmediate. Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it reduces stress\nand eases your nicotine cravings now. Overeating is harmful in the\nlong run but appetizing in the moment. Sex—safe or not—provides\npleasure right away. Disease and infection won’t show up for days or\nweeks, even years.\nEvery habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately,\nthese outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the\nimmediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels\nbad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is\nunenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. The French\neconomist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he\nwrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate\nconsequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and\nvice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more\nbitter are its later fruits.”\nPut another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present.\nThe costs of your bad habits are in the future.\nThe brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you\ncan’t rely on good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight,\nwrite a book, or learn a language—you are actually making plans for\nyour future self. And when you envision what you want your life to be\nlike, it is easy to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits.\nWe all want better lives for our future selves. However, when the\nmoment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins. You are\nno longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being fitter\nor wealthier or happier. You are choosing for Present You, who wants\nto be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general rule, the more\nimmediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you\nshould question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.*\nWith a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat some\nbehaviors and avoid others, let’s update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior\nChange: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is\nimmediately punished is avoided.\nOur preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth\nabout success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all\nday chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road\nof delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll\nface less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes,\nthe last mile is always the least crowded.\nThis is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at\ndelaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance\nabuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and\nsuperior social skills. We’ve all seen this play out in our own lives. If\nyou delay watching television and get your homework done, you’ll\ngenerally learn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy desserts\nand chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when you get\nhome. At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to\nignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.\nHere’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is\nthe wise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be\nhealthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-\nmind at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself\nto delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human\nnature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of\nimmediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a\nlittle bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.\nHOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE\nThe vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if\nit’s in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid\noff and that the work was worth the effort.\nIn a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In\nthe real world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have\nprovided you with something. Early on, it’s all sacrifice. You’ve gone to\nthe gym a few times, but you’re not stronger or fitter or faster—at least,\nnot in any noticeable sense. It’s only months later, once you shed a few\npounds or your arms gain some definition, that it becomes easier to\nexercise for its own sake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stay\non track. This is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep you\nexcited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.\nWhat we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing\nimmediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any\nexperience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other\nphases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The best\napproach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using\nan immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. Habit stacking,\nwhich we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue,\nwhich makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to\nan immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.\nImmediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing\nwith habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing.\nIt can be challenging to stick with habits like “no frivolous purchases”\nor “no alcohol this month” because nothing happens when you skip\nhappy hour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel\nsatisfied when there is no action in the first place. All you’re doing is\nresisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about that.\nOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make\navoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something\nyou want—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase,\nput the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning\nlatte? Transfer $5. Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over.\nIt’s like creating a loyalty program for yourself. The immediate reward\nof seeing yourself save money toward the leather jacket feels a lot\nbetter than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.\nOne of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted to\nstop eating out so much and start cooking together more. They labeled\ntheir savings account “Trip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going\nout to eat, they transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year,\nthey put the money toward the vacation.\nIt is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards\nthat reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.\nBuying a new jacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more\nbooks, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to budget and save money.\nInstead, taking a bubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good\nexamples of rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with your\nultimate goal of more freedom and financial independence. Similarly,\nif your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re\ncasting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash.\nInstead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a\nvote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward is\naligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person.\nEventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy,\nand reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing\nthe secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You\ndo it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a\nhabit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside\nencouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity\nsustains a habit.\nThat said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new\nidentity to emerge. Immediate reinforcement helps maintain\nmotivation in the short term while you’re waiting for the long-term\nrewards to arrive.\nIn summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits\nof reinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a\nrefreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can\noffer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is\neasy when it is enjoyable.\nChapter Summary\nThe 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is\nsatisfying.\nThe human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over\ndelayed rewards.\nThe Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately\nrewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.\nTo get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—\neven if it’s in a small way.\nThe first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it\nattractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior\nwill be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change\n—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be\nrepeated next time.\nI\n16\nHow to Stick with Good Habits Every Day\nN 1993, a bank in Abbotsford, Canada, hired a twenty-three-year-old\nstockbroker named Trent Dyrsmid. Abbotsford was a relatively small\nsuburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most\nof the big business deals were being made. Given the location, and the\nfact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. But\nhe made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit.\nDyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was\nfilled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled\nin each day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would\nmove one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process\nwould begin again. “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips\nin one jar and I would keep dialing the phone until I had moved them\nall to the second jar,” he told me.\nWithin eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the\nfirm. By age twenty-four, he was making $75,000 per year—the\nequivalent of $125,000 today. Not long after, he landed a six-figure job\nwith another company.\nI like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over\nthe years, I’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of\nways. One woman shifted a hairpin from one container to another\nwhenever she wrote a page of her book. Another man moved a marble\nfrom one bin to the next after each set of push-ups.\nMaking progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving\npaper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your\nprogress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of\nimmediate satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes in\nmany forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the\nprogress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a\nbook. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a\nhabit tracker.\nHOW TO KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.\nThe most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you\nstick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday,\nWednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by,\nthe calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.\nCountless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most\nfamous was Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklin\ncarried a small booklet everywhere he went and used it to track\nthirteen personal virtues. This list included goals like “Lose no time. Be\nalways employed in something useful” and “Avoid trifling\nconversation.” At the end of each day, Franklin would open his booklet\nand record his progress.\nJerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak\nof writing jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his\ngoal is simply to “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. In\nother words, he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is\nor how inspired he feels. He is simply focused on showing up and\nadding to his streak.\n“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain\nof sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break\nthe chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t\nbreak the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an\nimpressive portfolio. Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages\nmultiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior\nobvious, attractive, and satisfying.\nLet’s break down each one.\nBenefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.\nRecording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next\none. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the\nstreak of X’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log.\nWhen you look at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded\nto act again. Research has shown that people who track their progress\non goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood\npressure are all more likely to improve than those who don’t. One\nstudy of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept\na daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. The\nmere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.\nHabit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted\nview of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do.\nMeasurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own\nbehavior and notice what’s really going on each day. One glance at the\npaper clips in the container and you immediately know how much\nwork you have (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence is right\nin front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself.\nBenefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.\nThe most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a\nsignal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to\ncontinue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an\naddictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.\nThis can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling\ndown, it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made.\nHabit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle\nreminder of how far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each\nmorning can motivate you to get started because you don’t want to lose\nyour progress by breaking the streak.\nBenefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.\nThis is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own\nform of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to\ncomplete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the\ncalendar. It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your\ninvestment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it\nfeels good, then you’re more likely to endure.\nHabit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused\non the process rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting six-\npack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the\ntype of person who doesn’t miss workouts.\nIn summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind\nyou to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress\nyou are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying\nwhenever you record another successful instance of your habit.\nFurthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting\nvotes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful\nform of immediate and intrinsic gratification.*\nYou may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have I\nwaited so long to talk about it?\nDespite all the benefits, I’ve left this discussion until now for a\nsimple reason: many people resist the idea of tracking and measuring.\nIt can feel like a burden because it forces you into two habits: the habit\nyou’re trying to build and the habit of tracking it. Counting calories\nsounds like a hassle when you’re already struggling to follow a diet.\nWriting down every sales call seems tedious when you’ve got work to\ndo. It feels easier to say, “I’ll just eat less.” Or, “I’ll try harder.” Or, “I’ll\nremember to do it.” People inevitably tell me things like, “I have a\ndecision journal, but I wish I used it more.” Or, “I recorded my\nworkouts for a week, but then quit.” I’ve been there myself. I once\nmade a food log to track my calories. I managed to do it for one meal\nand then gave up.\nTracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your\nentire life. But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if\nit’s only temporary.\nWhat can we do to make tracking easier?\nFirst, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. You’ll\nprobably be surprised by how much you’re already tracking without\nknowing it. Your credit card statement tracks how often you go out to\neat. Your Fitbit registers how many steps you take and how long you\nsleep. Your calendar records how many new places you travel to each\nyear. Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar\nto review it each week or each month, which is more practical than\ntracking it every day.\nSecond, manual tracking should be limited to your most important\nhabits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically\ntrack ten.\nFinally, record each measurement immediately after the habit\noccurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This\napproach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned\nin Chapter 5 with habit tracking.\nThe habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:\nAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].\nAfter I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper\nclip over.\nAfter I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout\njournal.\nAfter I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I\nate.\nThese tactics can make tracking your habits easier. Even if you\naren’t the type of person who enjoys recording your behavior, I think\nyou’ll find a few weeks of measurements to be insightful. It’s always\ninteresting to see how you’ve actually been spending your time.\nThat said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more\nimportant than any single measurement, is having a good plan for\nwhen your habits slide off track.\nHOW TO RECOVER QUICKLY WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK\nDOWN\nNo matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that\nlife will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before\nlong, an emergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel for\nwork or your family needs a little more of your time.\nWhenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple\nrule: never miss twice.\nIf I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible.\nMissing one workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row.\nMaybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I\ncan’t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak\nends, I get started on the next one.\nThe first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of\nrepeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing\ntwice is the start of a new habit.\nThis is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone\ncan have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But\nwhen successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a\nhabit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.\nI think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’t\ndo a habit as well or as completely as I would like. Too often, we fall\ninto an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not\nslipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something\nperfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.\nYou don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or\nbusy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If\nyou start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But\nyou only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other\nwords, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50\npercent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding:\nNever interrupt it unnecessarily.”\nThis is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones.\nSluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you\naccrued from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten\nsquats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a\nzero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.\nFurthermore, it’s not always about what happens during the\nworkout. It’s about being the type of person who doesn’t miss\nworkouts. It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show\nup when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope. Going\nto the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it\nreaffirms your identity.\nThe all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that\ncan derail your habits. Another potential danger—especially if you are\nusing a habit tracker—is measuring the wrong thing.\nKNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT\nSay you’re running a restaurant and you want to know if your chef is\ndoing a good job. One way to measure success is to track how many\ncustomers pay for a meal each day. If more customers come in, the\nfood must be good. If fewer customers come in, something must be\nwrong.\nHowever, this one measurement—daily revenue—only gives a\nlimited picture of what’s really going on. Just because someone pays\nfor a meal doesn’t mean they enjoy the meal. Even dissatisfied\ncustomers are unlikely to dine and dash. In fact, if you’re only\nmeasuring revenue, the food might be getting worse but you’re making\nup for it with marketing or discounts or some other method. Instead, it\nmay be more effective to track how many customers finish their meal\nor perhaps the percentage of customers who leave a generous tip.\nThe dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become\ndriven by the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your\nsuccess is measured by quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales,\nrevenue, and accounting for quarterly earnings. If your success is\nmeasured by a lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower\nnumber on the scale, even if that means embracing crash diets, juice\ncleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to “win” whatever\ngame is being played.\nThis pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working\nlong hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more\nabout getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We\nteach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity,\nand critical thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When\nwe choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.\nThis is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the\neconomist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure\nbecomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only\nuseful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not\nwhen it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in\nthe overall system.\nIn our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and\nundervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We\nmistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that\nexist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s\nthe most important thing. And just because you can’t measure\nsomething doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.\nAll of this to say, it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its proper\nplace. It can feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress,\nbut the measurement is not the only thing that matters. Furthermore,\nthere are many ways to measure progress, and sometimes it helps to\nshift your focus to something entirely different.\nThis is why nonscale victories can be effective for weight loss. The\nnumber on the scale may be stubborn, so if you focus solely on that\nnumber, your motivation will sag. But you may notice that your skin\nlooks better or you wake up earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of\nthese are valid ways to track your improvement. If you’re not feeling\nmotivated by the number on the scale, perhaps it’s time to focus on a\ndifferent measurement—one that gives you more signals of progress.\nNo matter how you measure your improvement, habit tracking\noffers a simple way to make your habits more satisfying. Each\nmeasurement provides a little bit of evidence that you’re moving in the\nright direction and a brief moment of immediate pleasure for a job well\ndone.\nChapter Summary\nOne of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making\nprogress.\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a\nhabit—like marking an X on a calendar.\nHabit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make\nyour habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your\nprogress.\nDon’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.\nNever miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as\nquickly as possible.\nJust because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the\nmost important thing.\nA\n17\nHow an Accountability Partner Can\nChange Everything\nFTER SERVING AS a pilot in World War II, Roger Fisher attended\nHarvard Law School and spent thirty-four years specializing in\nnegotiation and conflict management. He founded the Harvard\nNegotiation Project and worked with numerous countries and world\nleaders on peace resolutions, hostage crises, and diplomatic\ncompromises. But it was in the 1970s and 1980s, as the threat of\nnuclear war escalated, that Fisher developed perhaps his most\ninteresting idea.\nAt the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that could\nprevent nuclear war, and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sitting\npresident would have access to launch codes that could kill millions of\npeople but would never actually see anyone die because he would\nalways be thousands of miles away.\n“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that\n[nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and then implant that\ncapsule right next to the heart of a volunteer. The volunteer would\ncarry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the\nPresident. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the\nonly way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to\nkill one human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m sorry but tens\nof millions must die.’ He has to look at someone and realize what death\nis—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s\nreality brought home.\n“When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, ‘My\nGod, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the\nPresident’s judgment. He might never push the button.’”\nThroughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change we\nhave covered the importance of making good habits immediately\nsatisfying. Fisher’s proposal is an inversion of the 4th Law: Make it\nimmediately unsatisfying.\nJust as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending\nis satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the\nending is painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it\ngets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more\nimmediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from\nit. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good at his job.\nThe possibility of a customer never returning makes restaurants create\ngood food. The cost of cutting the wrong blood vessel makes a surgeon\nmaster human anatomy and cut carefully. When the consequences are\nsevere, people learn quickly.\nThe more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you\nwant to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then\nadding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.\nWe repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that\nmakes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this\npredicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with\nthe behavior. There can’t be a gap between the action and the\nconsequences.\nAs soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior\nbegins to change. Customers pay their bills on time when they are\ncharged a late fee. Students show up to class when their grade is linked\nto attendance. We’ll jump through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of\nimmediate pain.\nThere is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely on\npunishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment\nmust match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct.\nTo be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the\ncost of action. To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than\nthe cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a restaurant or failing\nto recycle adds consequence to an action. Behavior only shifts if the\npunishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.\nIn general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the\nconsequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior. The\nmore global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less\nlikely it is to influence individual behavior.\nThankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost\nto any bad habit: create a habit contract.\nTHE HABIT CONTRACT\nThe first seat belt law was passed in New York on December 1, 1984. At\nthe time, just 14 percent of people in the United States regularly wore a\nseat belt—but that was all about to change.\nWithin five years, over half of the nation had seat belt laws. Today,\nwearing a seat belt is enforceable by law in forty-nine of the fifty states.\nAnd it’s not just the legislation, the number of people wearing seat\nbelts has changed dramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of\nAmericans buckled up each time they got in a car. In just over thirty\nyears, there was a complete reversal in the habits of millions of people.\nLaws and regulations are an example of how government can\nchange our habits by creating a social contract. As a society, we\ncollectively agree to abide by certain rules and then enforce them as a\ngroup. Whenever a new piece of legislation impacts behavior—seat belt\nlaws, banning smoking inside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is\nan example of a social contract shaping our habits. The group agrees to\nact in a certain way, and if you don’t follow along, you’ll be punished.\nJust as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can\ncreate a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is\na verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a\nparticular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow\nthrough. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability\npartners and sign off on the contract with you.\nBryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, Tennessee, was the\nfirst person I saw put this strategy into action. Shortly after the birth of\nhis son, Harris realized he wanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a\nhabit contract between himself, his wife, and his personal trainer. The\nfirst version read, “Bryan’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eating\ncorrectly again so he feels better, looks better, and is able to hit his\nlong-term goal of 200 pounds at 10% body fat.”\nBelow that statement, Harris laid out a road map for achieving his\nideal outcome:\nPhase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.\nPhase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking program in Q2.\nPhase #3: Refine and maintain the details of his diet and workout\nprogram in Q3.\nFinally, he wrote out each of the daily habits that would get him to\nhis goal. For example, “Write down all food that he consumes each day\nand weigh himself each day.”\nAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan doesn’t do\nthese two items then the following consequence will be enforced: He\nwill have to dress up each workday and each Sunday morning for the\nrest of the quarter. Dress up is defined as not wearing jeans, t-shirts,\nhoodies, or shorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as\nhe sees fit if he misses one day of logging food.”\nAt the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all signed\nthe contract.\nMy initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly\nformal and unnecessary, especially the signatures. But Harris\nconvinced me that signing the contract was an indication of\nseriousness. “Anytime I skip this part,” he said, “I start slacking almost\nimmediately.”\nThree months later, after hitting his targets for Q1, Harris upgraded\nhis goals. The consequences escalated, too. If he missed his\ncarbohydrate and protein targets, he had to pay his trainer $100. And\nif he failed to weigh himself, he had to give his wife $500 to use as she\nsaw fit. Perhaps most painfully, if he forgot to run sprints, he had to\ndress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the rest of the\nquarter—the bitter rival of his beloved Auburn team.\nThe strategy worked. With his wife and trainer acting as\naccountability partners and with the habit contract clarifying exactly\nwhat to do each day, Harris lost the weight.*\nTo make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them\npainful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward\nway to do exactly that.\nEven if you don’t want to create a full-blown habit contract, simply\nhaving an accountability partner is useful. The comedian Margaret Cho\nwrites a joke or song every day. She does the “song a day” challenge\nwith a friend, which helps them both stay accountable. Knowing that\nsomeone is watching can be a powerful motivator. You are less likely to\nprocrastinate or give up because there is an immediate cost. If you\ndon’t follow through, perhaps they’ll see you as untrustworthy or lazy.\nSuddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your promises to yourself,\nbut also failing to uphold your promises to others.\nYou can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an\nentrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning.\nAnd if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says,\n“It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via\nPayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t malfunction.”\nWe are always trying to present our best selves to the world. We\ncomb our hair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully\nbecause we know these habits are likely to get a positive reaction. We\nwant to get good grades and graduate from top schools to impress\npotential employers and mates and our friends and family. We care\nabout the opinions of those around us because it helps if others like us.\nThis is precisely why getting an accountability partner or signing a\nhabit contract can work so well.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it\nunsatisfying.\nWe are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or\nunsatisfying.\nAn accountability partner can create an immediate cost to\ninaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do\nnot want others to have a lesser opinion of us.\nA habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior.\nIt makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.\nKnowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful\nmotivator.\nHOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Make It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.\n1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”\n1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\n1.4: Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.\nThe 2nd Law:Make It Attractive\n2.1: Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.\n2.2: Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.\n2.3: Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.\nThe 3rd Law: Make It Easy\n3.1: Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.\n3.2: Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.\n3.3: Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.\n3.4: Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes\nor less.\n3.5: Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future\nbehavior.\nThe 4th Law: Make It Satisfying\n4.1: Use reinforcement.

Phelps has\nwon more Olympic medals not only than any swimmer but also more\nthan any Olympian in any sport.\nFewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was a\nfantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner\nwho holds two Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-\ndistance runners of all time. For many years, he held the world record\nin the mile, 1,500-meter, and 2,000-meter races. At the Olympic\nGames in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter and\n5,000-meter races.\nThese two athletes are wildly different in many ways. (For starters,\none competed on land and the other in water.) But most notably, they\ndiffer significantly in height. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches tall.\nPhelps is six feet, four inches tall. Despite this seven-inch difference in\nheight, the two men are identical in one respect: Michael Phelps and\nHicham El Guerrouj wear the same length inseam on their pants.\nHow is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for his height\nand a very long torso, the perfect build for swimming. El Guerrouj has\nincredibly long legs and a short upper body, an ideal frame for distance\nrunning.\nNow, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch sports.\nGiven his remarkable athleticism, could Michael Phelps become an\nOlympic-caliber distance runner with enough training? It’s unlikely. At\npeak fitness, Phelps weighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier\nthan El Guerrouj, who competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. Taller\nrunners are heavier runners, and every extra pound is a curse when it\ncomes to distance running. Against elite competition, Phelps would be\ndoomed from the start.\nSimilarly, El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in history,\nbut it’s doubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer.\nSince 1976, the average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s\n1,500-meter run is five feet, ten inches. In comparison, the average\nheight of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle\nswim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and have long\nbacks and arms, which are ideal for pulling through the water. El\nGuerrouj would be at a severe disadvantage before he ever touched the\npool.\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right\nfield of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with\nsports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying\nto stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and\nabilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the\ntrack, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.\nEmbracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth\nthat people are born with different abilities. Some people don’t like to\ndiscuss this fact. On the surface, your genes seem to be fixed, and it’s\nno fun to talk about things you cannot control. Plus, phrases like\nbiological determinism makes it sound like certain individuals are\ndestined for success and others doomed to failure. But this is a\nshortsighted view of the influence of genes on behavior.\nThe strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot be\neasily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in\nfavorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable\ncircumstances. If you want to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is\nvery useful. If you want to perform a gymnastics routine, being seven\nfeet tall is a great hindrance. Our environment determines the\nsuitability of our genes and the utility of our natural talents. When our\nenvironment changes, so do the qualities that determine success.\nThis is true not just for physical characteristics but for mental ones\nas well. I’m smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior; not\nso much when it comes to knitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords.\nCompetence is highly dependent on context.\nThe people at the top of any competitive field are not only well\ntrained, they are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you\nwant to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.\nIn short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your\nareas of opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can\npredispose, but they don’t predetermine.” The areas where you are\ngenetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more\nlikely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your effort toward areas that\nboth excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition\nwith your ability.\nThe obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in\nmy favor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right\nfor me?” The first place we will look for an answer is by understanding\nyour personality.\nHOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS\nYour genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed,\nbeneath the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to\ninfluence everything from the number of hours you spend watching\ntelevision to your likelihood to marry or divorce to your tendency to get\naddicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine. There’s a strong genetic\ncomponent to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing\nauthority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how\nproactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored\nyou feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert. As Robert\nPlomin, a behavioral geneticist at King’s College in London, told me,\n“It is now at the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits\nhave a genetic component because we literally can’t find a single one\nthat isn’t influenced by our genes.”\nBundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose\nyou to a particular personality. Your personality is the set of\ncharacteristics that is consistent from situation to situation. The most\nproven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big\nFive,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.\n1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end\nto cautious and consistent on the other.\n2. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and\nspontaneous.\n3. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved\n(you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).\n4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and\ndetached.\n5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and\nstable.\nAll five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion,\nfor instance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise in\nthe nursing ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away.\nWhen the researchers tracked these children through life, they found\nthat the babies who turned toward the noise were more likely to grow\nup to be extroverts. Those who turned away were more likely to\nbecome introverts.\nPeople who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and\nwarm. They also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a\nhormone that plays an important role in social bonding, increases\nfeelings of trust, and can act as a natural antidepressant. You can easily\nimagine how someone with more oxytocin might be inclined to build\nhabits like writing thank-you notes or organizing social events.\nAs a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality\ntrait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in\nneuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait\nhas been linked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the\nbrain responsible for noticing threats. In other words, people who are\nmore sensitive to negative cues in their environment are more likely to\nscore high in neuroticism.\nOur habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there\nis no doubt that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeply\nrooted preferences make certain behaviors easier for some people than\nfor others. You don’t have to apologize for these differences or feel\nguilty about them, but you do have to work with them. A person who\nscores lower on conscientiousness, for example, will be less likely to be\norderly by nature and may need to rely more heavily on environment\ndesign to stick with good habits. (As a reminder for the less\nconscientious readers among us, environment design is a strategy we\ndiscussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)\nThe takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your\npersonality.* People can get ripped working out like a bodybuilder, but\nif you prefer rock climbing or cycling or rowing, then shape your\nexercise habit around your interests. If your friend follows a low-carb\ndiet but you find that low-fat works for you, then more power to you. If\nyou want to read more, don’t be embarrassed if you prefer steamy\nromance novels over nonfiction. Read whatever fascinates you.* You\ndon’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the\nhabit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.\nThere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and\nsatisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to\nstick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law.\nTailoring your habits to your personality is a good start, but this is\nnot the end of the story. Let’s turn our attention to finding and\ndesigning situations where you’re at a natural advantage.\nHOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR\nLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for\nmaintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can\nenjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the\nthings that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular\narea tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for\ndoing a good job. They stay energized because they are making\nprogress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with\nbetter pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them\nhappier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It’s\na virtuous cycle.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and\nlife is a struggle.\nHow do you pick the right habit? The first step is something we\ncovered in the 3rd Law: make it easy. In many cases, when people pick\nthe wrong habit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too\ndifficult. When a habit is easy, you are more likely to be successful.\nWhen you are successful, you are more likely to feel satisfied. However,\nthere is another level to consider. In the long-run, if you continue to\nadvance and improve, any area can become challenging. At some\npoint, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your\nskillset. How do you figure that out?\nThe most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there’s a\nproblem with this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try\nevery career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musical\ninstrument. Thankfully, there is an effective way to manage this\nconundrum, and it is known as the explore/exploit trade-off.\nIn the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of\nexploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the\nliberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out\nmany possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.\nAfter this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best\nsolution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The\nproper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you\nare currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently\nlosing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.\nIn the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy\nthat seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the\ntime and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google\nfamously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their\nofficial job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led to\nthe creation of blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.\nThe optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. If\nyou have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career—\nit makes more sense to explore because once you find the right thing,\nyou still have a good amount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for\ntime—say, as you come up on the deadline for a project—you should\nimplement the best solution you’ve found so far and get some results.\nAs you explore different options, there are a series of questions you\ncan ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that\nwill be most satisfying to you:\nWhat feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of\nwhether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but\nwhether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most\npeople. When are you enjoying yourself while other people are\ncomplaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is\nthe work you were made to do.\nWhat makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state\nyou enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the\nrest of the world fades away. This blend of happiness and peak\nperformance is what athletes and performers experience when\nthey are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow\nstate and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.\nWhere do I get greater returns than the average person?\nWe are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a\nbehavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in\nour favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list\ngrew very quickly. I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well, but I\nknew that results seemed to be coming faster for me than for\nsome of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing.\nWhat comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what\nyou have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore\nwhat others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What\nfeels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like\nthe real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No\nsecond-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and\nenjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are\nheaded in the right direction.\nTo be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and\nHicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities\nthat are highly valued by society and to be placed in the ideal\nenvironment for those abilities. We all have limited time on this planet,\nand the truly great among us are the ones who not only work hard but\nalso have the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that favor us.\nBut what if you don’t want to leave it up to luck?\nIf you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor,\ncreate one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says,\n“Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top\n25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people,\nbut I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average\nstandup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most\npeople. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s\nthe combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when\nyou add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few\ncartoonists could hope to understand without living it.”\nWhen you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different.\nBy combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which\nmakes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic\nadvantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good\nplayer works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great\nplayer creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their\nweaknesses.\nIn college, I designed my own major, biomechanics, which was a\ncombination of physics, chemistry, biology, and anatomy. I wasn’t\nsmart enough to stand out among the top physics or biology majors, so\nI created my own game. And because it suited me—I was only taking\nthe courses I was interested in—studying felt like less of a chore. It was\nalso easier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone else. After\nall, nobody else was taking the same combination of classes, so who\ncould say if they were better or worse?\nSpecialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad\ngenetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes\nfor others to compete with you. Many bodybuilders are stronger than\nthe average arm wrestler, but even a massive bodybuilder may lose at\narm wrestling because the arm wrestling champ has very specific\nstrength. Even if you’re not the most naturally gifted, you can often win\nby being the best in a very narrow category.\nBoiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t\ncontrol whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a\ngame where it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more\nfavorable environment, you can transform the situation from one\nwhere the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.\nHOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES\nOur genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it.\nThey tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we\nknow where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of\nopportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The\nbetter we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.\nBiological differences matter. Even so, it’s more productive to focus\non whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing\nyourself to someone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any\nspecific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching the\nceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that they\nhave limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to\nthem.\nFurthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing\nthe work. Yes, it’s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better\ngenes, but if you haven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say if\nyou have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as\nhard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.\nIn summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain\nsatisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your\npersonality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.\nChapter Summary\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the\nright field of competition.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and\nlife is a struggle.\nGenes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a\npowerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious\ndisadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.\nHabits are easier when they align with your natural abilities.\nChoose the habits that best suit you.\nPlay a game that favors your strengths.

Labor laws were\nloose back then and the boy managed to land a position selling\nguidebooks for $0.50 apiece.\nWithin a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he\nlearned tricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokes\nand tried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that what\nhe loved was not performing magic but performing in general. He set\nhis sights on becoming a comedian.\nBeginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs\naround Los Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was short. He\nwas rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of the people in\nthe crowd were too busy drinking or talking with friends to pay\nattention. One night, he literally delivered his stand-up routine to an\nempty club.\nIt wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting\nbetter. His first routines would only last one or two minutes. By high\nschool, his material had expanded to include a five-minute act and, a\nfew years later, a ten-minute show. At nineteen, he was performing\nweekly for twenty minutes at a time. He had to read three poems\nduring the show just to make the routine long enough, but his skills\ncontinued to progress.\nHe spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing.\nHe took a job as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to land\nhis own appearances on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked\nhis way into being a regular guest on The Tonight Show and Saturday\nNight Live.\nFinally, after nearly fifteen years of work, the young man rose to\nfame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two cities\nin eighty days. Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. He had 18,695\npeople attend one show in Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold for\nhis three-day show in New York. He catapulted to the top of his genre\nand became one of the most successful comedians of his time.\nHis name is Steve Martin.\nMartin’s story offers a fascinating perspective on what it takes to\nstick with habits for the long run. Comedy is not for the timid. It is\nhard to imagine a situation that would strike fear into the hearts of\nmore people than performing alone on stage and failing to get a single\nlaugh. And yet Steve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen\nyears. In his words, “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining,\nand 4 years as a wild success.”\nWhy is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their habits—\nwhether practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or playing guitar—while\nmost of us struggle to stay motivated? How do we design habits that\npull us in rather than ones that fade away? Scientists have been\nstudying this question for many years. While there is still much to\nlearn, one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain\nmotivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just\nmanageable difficulty.”\nThe human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an\noptimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious\nmatch against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too\neasy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional\ntennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly\nlose motivation because the match is too difficult.\nNow consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As\nthe game progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You have\na good chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your focus\nnarrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested in\nthe task at hand. This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and it\nis a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation\nwhen working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current\nabilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.\nTHE GOLDILOCKS RULE\nFIGURE 15: Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge of just\nmanageable difficulty. In psychology research this is known as the Yerkes–\nDodson law, which describes the optimal level of arousal as the midpoint\nbetween boredom and anxiety.\nMartin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the Goldilocks\nRule in practice. Each year, he expanded his comedy routine—but only\nby a minute or two. He was always adding new material, but he also\nkept a few jokes that were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just\nenough victories to keep him motivated and just enough mistakes to\nkeep him working hard.\nWhen you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the\nbehavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when\nconditions aren’t perfect. This is an idea we covered in detail while\ndiscussing the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.\nOnce a habit has been established, however, it’s important to\ncontinue to advance in small ways. These little improvements and new\nchallenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just\nright, you can achieve a flow state.*\nA flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully\nimmersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling.\nThey found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4\npercent beyond your current ability. In real life it’s typically not\nfeasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core\nidea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just\nmanageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—\nseems crucial for maintaining motivation.\nImprovement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly\nsearch for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to\nmake enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain\nnovel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without\nvariety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on\nthe quest for self-improvement.\nHOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON\nYOUR GOALS\nAfter my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new sport. I joined\na weightlifting team and one day an elite coach visited our gym. He had\nworked with thousands of athletes during his long career, including a\nfew Olympians. I introduced myself and we began talking about the\nprocess of improvement.\n“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?”\nI asked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?”\nHe mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent.\nBut then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes\ndown to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the\nsame lifts over and over and over.”\nHis answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking\nabout work ethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on\ntheir goals. Whether it’s business or sports or art, you hear people say\nthings like, “It all comes down to passion.” Or, “You have to really want\nit.” As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or\nmotivation because we think that successful people have some\nbottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that really\nsuccessful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The\ndifference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of\nboredom.\nMastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the\nmore boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have\nbeen made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade.\nSometimes it happens even faster than that. All you have to do is hit\nthe gym a few days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time\nand letting one day slip doesn’t feel like much. Things are going well.\nIt’s easy to rationalize taking a day off because you’re in a good place.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get\nbored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome\nbecomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start\nderailing our progress to seek novelty. Perhaps this is why we get\ncaught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the\nnext, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we\nexperience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new\nstrategy—even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted,\n“Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well\nwish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”\nPerhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are\nthose that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide\nvisual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide\nculinary novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements of\nsurprise.\nIn psychology, this is known as a variable reward.* Slot machines\nare the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot\nevery now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of\nrewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine,\nenhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.\nVariable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a\nreward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval,\nand hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to\namplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce\nboredom.\nThe sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and\nfailure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you\ndon’t. You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and\njust enough “wanting” to experience desire. This is one of the benefits\nof following the Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit,\nworking on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way to\nkeep things interesting.\nOf course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you\nwouldn’t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result\nsome of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber\nonly picked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much\nlonger. And if I flossed my teeth each night and only sometimes ended\nup with a clean mouth, I think I’d skip it.\nVariable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At\nsome point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-\nimprovement: you have to fall in love with boredom.\nWe all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we\nwould like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become\nbetter at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then\nyou’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.\nI can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking\nto it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a\nbusiness, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. When\nyou’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing.\nWhen it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like\ntyping. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do\nso, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an\namateur.\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.\nProfessionals know what is important to them and work toward it with\npurpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.\nDavid Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his\nstudents to avoid being “fair-weather meditators.” Similarly, you don’t\nwant to be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-\nweather anything. When a habit is truly important to you, you have to\nbe willing to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action even\nwhen the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way\nto put the reps in.\nThere have been a lot of sets that I haven’t felt like finishing, but I’ve\nnever regretted doing the workout. There have been a lot of articles I\nhaven’t felt like writing, but I’ve never regretted publishing on\nschedule. There have been a lot of days I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve\nnever regretted showing up and working on something that was\nimportant to me.\nThe only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by\ndoing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with\nboredom.\nChapter Summary\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak\nmotivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of\ntheir current abilities.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.\nAs habits become routine, they become less interesting and less\nsatisfying. We get bored.\nAnyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to\nkeep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the\nway.\nH\n20\nThe Downside of Creating Good Habits\nABITS CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR MASTERY. In chess, it is only after\nthe basic movements of the pieces have become automatic that a\nplayer can focus on the next level of the game. Each chunk of\ninformation that is memorized opens up the mental space for more\neffortful thinking. This is true for any endeavor. When you know the\nsimple movements so well that you can perform them without\nthinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details. In this\nway, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.\nHowever, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each\nrepetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit\nbecomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall\ninto mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When\nyou can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how\nto do it better.\nThe upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The\ndownside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way\nand stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting\nbetter because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely\nreinforcing your current habits—not improving them. In fact, some\nresearch has shown that once a skill has been mastered there is usually\na slight decline in performance over time.\nUsually, this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry. You\ndon’t need a system to continuously improve how well you brush your\nteeth or tie your shoes or make your morning cup of tea. With habits\nlike these, good enough is usually good enough. The less energy you\nspend on trivial choices, the more you can spend it on what really\nmatters.\nHowever, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve\nelite levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You\ncan’t repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional.\nHabits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a\ncombination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\nTo become great, certain skills do need to become automatic.\nBasketball players need to be able to dribble without thinking before\nthey can move on to mastering layups with their nondominant hand.\nSurgeons need to repeat the first incision so many times that they\ncould do it with their eyes closed, so that they can focus on the\nhundreds of variables that arise during surgery. But after one habit has\nbeen mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and\nbegin building the next habit.\nMastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of\nsuccess, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then\nusing this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier\nof your development. Old tasks become easier the second time around,\nbut it doesn’t get easier overall because now you’re pouring your\nenergy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of\nperformance. It’s an endless cycle.\nMASTERING ONE HABIT\nMASTERING A FIELD\nFIGURE 16: The process of mastery requires that you progressively layer\nimprovements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a\nnew level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has\nbeen internalized.\nAlthough habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain\nconscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine\nand improve. It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like\nyou have mastered a skill—right when things are starting to feel\nautomatic and you are becoming comfortable—that you must avoid\nslipping into the trap of complacency.\nThe solution? Establish a system for reflection and review.\nHOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS\nIn 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talented\nbasketball teams ever assembled, but they are rarely remembered that\nway. The team started the 1985–1986 NBA season with an astounding\n29–5 record. “The pundits were saying that we might be the best team\nin the history of basketball,” head coach Pat Riley said after the season.\nSurprisingly, the Lakers stumbled in the 1986 playoffs and suffered a\nseason-ending defeat in the Western Conference Finals. The “best\nteam in the history of basketball” didn’t even play for the NBA\nchampionship.\nAfter that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent\nhis players had and about how much promise his team held. He didn’t\nwant to see flashes of brilliance followed by a gradual fade in\nperformance. He wanted the Lakers to play up to their potential, night\nafter night. In the summer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that,\na system that he called the Career Best Effort program or CBE.\n“When players first join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we track their\nbasketball statistics all the way back to high school. I call this Taking\nTheir Number. We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can do,\nthen build him into our plan for the team, based on the notion that he\nwill maintain and then improve upon his averages.”\nAfter determining a player’s baseline level of performance, Riley\nadded a key step. He asked each player to “improve their output by at\nleast 1 percent over the course of the season. If they succeeded, it\nwould be a CBE, or Career Best Effort.” Similar to the British Cycling\nteam that we discussed in Chapter 1, the Lakers sought peak\nperformance by getting slightly better each day.\nRiley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points\nor statistics but about giving your “best effort spiritually and mentally\nand physically.” Players got credit for “allowing an opponent to run\ninto you when you know that a foul will be called against him, diving\nfor loose balls, going after rebounds whether you are likely to get them\nor not, helping a teammate when the player he’s guarding has surged\npast him, and other ‘unsung hero’ deeds.”\nAs an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers star player\nat the time—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5\nturnovers in a game. Magic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed\nby diving after a loose ball (+1). Finally, he played a total of 33 minutes\nin this imaginary game.\nThe positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we\nsubtract the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33\nminutes played.\n29/33 = 0.879\nMagic’s CBE number here would be 879. This number was\ncalculated for all of a player’s games, and it was the average CBE that a\nplayer was asked to improve by 1 percent over the season. Riley\ncompared each player’s current CBE to not only their past\nperformances but also those of other players in the league. As Riley put\nit, “We rank team members alongside league opponents who play the\nsame position and have similar role definitions.”\nSportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top\nperformers in the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week\nand measured them against the corresponding players on his own\nroster. Solid, reliable players generally rated a score in the 600s, while\nelite players scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted 138\ntriple-doubles in his career, often scored over 1,000.”\nThe Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by making\nhistorical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “We stacked the month\nof November 1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players\nwhether they were doing better or worse than at the same point last\nseason. Then we showed them how their performance figures for\nDecember 1986, stacked up against November’s.”\nThe Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, they\nwere NBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team to\nanother title as the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to win\nback-to-back NBA championships. Afterward, he said, “Sustaining an\neffort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be\nsuccessful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same\nway every time.”\nThe CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection and\nreview. The Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the\nmost out of what they had, and made sure their habits improved rather\nthan declined.\nReflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all\nhabits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you\nconsider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can\nmake excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no\nprocess for determining whether we are performing better or worse\ncompared to yesterday.\nTop performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and\nreview, and the process doesn’t have to be complex. Kenyan runner\nEliud Kipchoge is one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an\nOlympic gold medalist. He still takes notes after every practice in\nwhich he reviews his training for the day and searches for areas that\ncan be improved. Similarly, gold medal swimmer Katie Ledecky\nrecords her wellness on a scale of 1 to 10 and includes notes on her\nnutrition and how well she slept. She also records the times posted by\nother swimmers. At the end of each week, her coach goes over her\nnotes and adds his thoughts.\nIt’s not just athletes, either. When comedian Chris Rock is preparing\nfresh material, he will first appear at small nightclubs dozens of times\nand test hundreds of jokes. He brings a notepad on stage and records\nwhich bits go over well and where he needs to make adjustments. The\nfew killer lines that survive will form the backbone of his new show.\nI know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in\nwhich they record the major decisions they make each week, why they\nmade them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their\nchoices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct\nand where they went wrong.*\nImprovement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-\ntuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time\non the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary—\nlike Pat Riley adjusting the effort of his players on a nightly basis. You\ndon’t want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective.\nPersonally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review.\nEach December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the\nprevious year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many\narticles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new\nplaces I visited, and more.* Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack\nthereof) by answering three questions:\n1. What went well this year?\n2. What didn’t go so well this year?\n3. What did I learn?\nSix months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity\nReport. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report\nhelps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on\ncourse. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether\nI have been living in accordance with them. This is when I reflect on\nmy identity and how I can work toward being the type of person I wish\nto become.*\nMy yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:\n1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?\n2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?\n3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?\nThese two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours per year—\nbut they are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual\nslide that happens when I don’t pay close attention. They provide an\nannual reminder to revisit my desired identity and consider how my\nhabits are helping me become the type of person I wish to be. They\nindicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on new challenges\nand when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the fundamentals.\nReflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are\npowerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about\nevery daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch\naway. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger\npicture. There is too much feedback. Conversely, never reviewing your\nhabits is like never looking in the mirror. You aren’t aware of easily\nfixable flaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your teeth. There is\ntoo little feedback. Periodic reflection and review is like viewing\nyourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the\nimportant changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger\npicture. You want to view the entire mountain range, not obsess over\neach peak and valley.\nFinally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of\nthe most important aspects of behavior change: identity.\nHOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THAT HOLD YOU BACK\nIn the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of\nyour desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however,\nthose same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth.\nWhen working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that\nencourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly\ngrowing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits.\nThe more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied\nto our identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism.\nYou see this in every industry. The schoolteacher who ignores\ninnovative teaching methods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson\nplans. The veteran manager who is committed to doing things “his\nway.” The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of her younger colleagues.\nThe band who produces a mind-blowing first album and then gets\nstuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes\nto grow beyond it.\nOne solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an\noverwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul\nGraham, “keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief\ndefine you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges\nyou. If you tie everything up in being the point guard or the partner at\nthe firm or whatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life will\nwreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a health condition that\nforces you to change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis on your\nhands. When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle.\nLose that one thing and you lose yourself.\nFor most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of my\nidentity. After my baseball career ended, I struggled to find myself.\nWhen you spend your whole life defining yourself in one way and that\ndisappears, who are you now?\nMilitary veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings.\nIf your identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what\nhappens when your period of service ends? For many business owners,\ntheir identity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the\nfounder.” If you have spent every waking moment working on your\nbusiness, how will you feel after you sell the company?\nThe key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself\nsuch that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if\nyour particular role changes.\n“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally\ntough and loves a physical challenge.”\n“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who\nis disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”\n“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds\nand creates things.”\nWhen chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than\nbrittle. Like water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with\nthe changing circumstances rather than against them.\nThe following quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideas\nperfectly:\nMen are born soft and supple;\ndead, they are stiff and hard.\nPlants are born tender and pliant;\ndead, they are brittle and dry.\nThus whoever is stiff and inflexible\nis a disciple of death.\nWhoever is soft and yielding\nis a disciple of life.\nThe hard and stiff will be broken.\nThe soft and supple will prevail.\n—LAO TZU\nHabits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can\nlock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when\nthe world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is\nconstantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your\nold habits and beliefs are still serving you.\nA lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the\nantidote.\nChapter Summary\nThe upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking.\nThe downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\nReflection and review is a process that allows you to remain\nconscious of your performance over time.\nThe tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow\nbeyond it.\nT\nConclusion\nThe Secret to Results That Last\nHERE IS AN ancient Greek parable known as the Sorites Paradox,*\nwhich talks about the effect one small action can have when\nrepeated enough times. One formulation of the paradox goes as\nfollows: Can one coin make a person rich? If you give a person a pile of\nten coins, you wouldn’t claim that he or she is rich. But what if you add\nanother? And another? And another? At some point, you will have to\nadmit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her so.\nWe can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny change\ntransform your life? It’s unlikely you would say so. But what if you\nmade another? And another? And another? At some point, you will\nhave to admit that your life was transformed by one small change.\nThe holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement,\nbut a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each\none a fundamental unit of the overall system.\nIn the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless\nbecause they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one\ncoin won’t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one\nminute or reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable\ndifference.\nGradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of\none another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like\nadding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting\nthings in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping\npoint. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of\nthe system is working for you rather than against you.\nOver the course of this book, we’ve looked at dozens of stories about\ntop performers. We’ve heard about Olympic gold medalists, award-\nwinning artists, business leaders, lifesaving physicians, and star\ncomedians who have all used the science of small habits to master their\ncraft and vault to the top of their field. Each of the people, teams, and\ncompanies we have covered has faced different circumstances, but\nultimately progressed in the same way: through a commitment to tiny,\nsustainable, unrelenting improvements.\nSuccess is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system\nto improve, an endless process to refine. In Chapter 1, I said, “If you’re\nhaving trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The\nproblem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again\nnot because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong\nsystem for change.”\nAs this book draws to a close, I hope the opposite is true. With the\nFour Laws of Behavior Change, you have a set of tools and strategies\nthat you can use to build better systems and shape better habits.\nSometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it\nobvious. Other times you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to\nmake it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too\ndifficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won’t feel\nlike sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying.\nBehaviors are effortless here.\nBehaviors are difficult here.\nObvious\nInvisible\nAttractive\nUnattractive\nEasy\nHard\nSatisfying\nUnsatisfying\nYou want to push your good habits toward the left side of the spectrum by\nmaking them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Meanwhile, you want\nto cluster your bad habits toward the right side by making them invisible,\nunattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.\nThis is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no\npermanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can\nrotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the\nnext bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy.\nMake it satisfying. Round and round. Always looking for the next way\nto get 1 percent better.\nThe secret to getting results that last is to never stop making\nimprovements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t\nstop. It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop\nworking. It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop\ntraining. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop\nlearning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop\nsaving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop\ncaring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound.\nThat’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable\nresults.\nAppendix\nT\nWhat Should You Read Next?\nHANK YOU SO much for taking the time to read this book. It has been\na pleasure sharing my work with you.

This framework not only teaches us\nhow to create new habits but also reveals some interesting insights\nabout human behavior.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\nSolution phase\n3. Response\n4. Reward\nIn this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few bits of\ncommon sense) that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these\nexamples is to clarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework\nis when describing human behavior. Once you understand the model,\nyou’ll see examples of it everywhere.\nAwareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you\nassign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to\ndescribe your current situation, and that means a craving can only\noccur after you have noticed an opportunity.\nHappiness is simply the absence of desire. When you observe\na cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the\ncurrent situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure\n(which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives\nwhen you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you\nenter when you no longer want to change your state.\nHowever, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes\nalong. As Caed Budris says, “Happiness is the space between one\ndesire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.” Likewise, suffering is\nthe space between craving a change in state and getting it.\nIt is the idea of pleasure that we chase. We seek the image of\npleasure that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do\nnot know what it will be like to attain that image (or even if it will\nsatisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction only comes afterward. This is\nwhat the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant when he said that\nhappiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued.\nPleasure ensues from action.\nPeace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into\nproblems. The first step in any behavior is observation. You notice a\ncue, a bit of information, an event. If you do not desire to act on what\nyou observe, then you are at peace.\nCraving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without\ncraving is the realization that you do not need to fix anything. Your\ndesires are not running rampant. You do not crave a change in state.\nYour mind does not generate a problem for you to solve. You’re simply\nobserving and existing.\nWith a big enough why you can overcome any how.\nFriedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously\nwrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This\nphrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your\nmotivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are you are\nacting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving\ncan power great action—even when friction is high.\nBeing curious is better than being smart. Being motivated\nand curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to\naction. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it\ndoesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts\nbehavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first\ncultivating a desire for it.”\nEmotions drive behavior. Every decision is an emotional\ndecision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking\naction, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In\nfact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain can list\nmany reasons for taking action but still will not act because they do not\nhave emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes before\nresponse. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.\nWe can only be rational and logical after we have been\nemotional. The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary\nmode is to think. Our first response—the fast, nonconscious portion of\nthe brain—is optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second\nresponse—the slow, conscious portion of the brain—is the part that\ndoes the “thinking.”\nPsychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid\njudgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first\n(System 1); the rationality only intervenes later (System 2). This works\ngreat when the two are aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional\nthinking when they are not.\nYour response tends to follow your emotions. Our thoughts\nand actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in\nwhat is logical. Two people can notice the same set of facts and\nrespond very differently because they run those facts through their\nunique emotional filter. This is one reason why appealing to emotion is\ntypically more powerful than appealing to reason. If a topic makes\nsomeone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the data. This\nis why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision making.\nPut another way: most people believe that the reasonable response\nis the one that benefits them: the one that satisfies their desires. To\napproach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows\nyou to base your response on the data rather than the emotion.\nSuffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the\ndesire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The\ndesire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is\nwanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, develop\nnew technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are\ndissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack\nambition.\nYour actions reveal how badly you want something. If you\nkeep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you\ndon’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with\nyourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.\nReward is on the other side of sacrifice. Response (sacrifice of\nenergy) always precedes reward (the collection of resources). The\n“runner’s high” only comes after the hard run. The reward only comes\nafter the energy is spent.\nSelf-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. A reward\nis an outcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control\nineffective because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve\nthem. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just\nignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-control requires\nyou to release a desire rather than satisfy it.\nOur expectations determine our satisfaction. The gap\nbetween our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel\nafter taking action. If the mismatch between expectations and\noutcomes is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to\nrepeat a behavior in the future. If the mismatch is negative\n(disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so.\nFor example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If\nyou expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your\nexpectation changes your satisfaction. An average experience preceded\nby high expectations is a disappointment. An average experience\npreceded by low expectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are\napproximately the same, you feel satisfied.\nSatisfaction = Liking – Wanting\nThis is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is\nnot having too little, it is wanting more.” If your wants outpace your\nlikes, you’ll always be unsatisfied. You’re perpetually putting more\nweight on the problem than the solution.\nHappiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing\npublicly it took me three months to get one thousand subscribers.\nWhen I hit that milestone, I told my parents and my girlfriend. We\ncelebrated. I felt excited and motivated. A few years later, I realized\nthat one thousand people were signing up each day. And yet I didn’t\neven think to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results ninety\ntimes faster than before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It\nwasn’t until a few days later that I realized how absurd it was that I\nwasn’t celebrating something that would have seemed like a pipe\ndream just a few years before.\nThe pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation.\nWhen desire is high, it hurts to not like the outcome. Failing to attain\nsomething you want hurts more than failing to attain something you\ndidn’t think much about in the first place. This is why people say, “I\ndon’t want to get my hopes up.”\nFeelings come both before and after the behavior. Before\nacting, there is a feeling that motivates you to act—the craving. After\nacting, there is a feeling that teaches you to repeat the action in the\nfuture—the reward.\nCue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)\nHow we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how\nwe feel.\nDesire initiates. Pleasure sustains. Wanting and liking are the\ntwo drivers of behavior. If it’s not desirable, you have no reason to do\nit. Desire and craving are what initiate a behavior. But if it’s not\nenjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it. Pleasure and satisfaction\nare what sustain a behavior. Feeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling\nsuccessful gets you to repeat.\nHope declines with experience and is replaced by\nacceptance. The first time an opportunity arises, there is hope of\nwhat could be. Your expectation (cravings) is based solely on promise.\nThe second time around, your expectation is grounded in reality. You\nbegin to understand how the process works and your hope is gradually\ntraded for a more accurate prediction and acceptance of the likely\noutcome.\nThis is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-\nquick or weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we don’t\nhave any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem\nmore appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope.\nAs Aristotle noted, “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to\nhope.” Perhaps this can be revised to “Youth is easily deceived because\nit only hopes.” There is no experience to root the expectation in. In the\nbeginning, hope is all you have.\nO\nHow to Apply These Ideas to Business\nVER THE YEARS, I’ve spoken at Fortune 500 companies and growing\nstart-ups about how to apply the science of small habits to run\nmore effective businesses and build better products. I’ve compiled\nmany of the most practical strategies into a short bonus chapter. I\nthink you’ll find it to be an incredibly useful addition to the main ideas\nmentioned in Atomic Habits.\nYou can download this chapter at: atomichabits.com/business\nO\nHow to Apply These Ideas to Parenting\nNE OF THE most common questions I hear from readers is\nsomething along the lines of, “How can I get my kids to do this\nstuff?” The ideas in Atomic Habits are intended to apply broadly to all\nof human behavior (teenagers are humans, too), which means you\nshould find plenty of useful strategies in the main text. That said,\nparenting does face its own set of challenges. As a bonus chapter, I’ve\nput together a brief guide on how to apply these ideas specifically to\nparenting.\nYou can download this chapter at: atomichabits.com/parenting\nI\nAcknowledgments\nHAVE RELIED HEAVILY on others during the creation of this book. Before\nanyone else, I must thank my wife, Kristy, who has been\nindispensable throughout this process. She has played every role a\nperson can play in the writing of a book: spouse, friend, fan, critic,\neditor, researcher, therapist. It is no exaggeration to say this book\nwould not be the same without her. It might not exist at all. Like\neverything in our life, we did it together.\nSecond, I am grateful to my family, not only for their support and\nencouragement on this book but also for believing in me no matter\nwhat project I happen to be working on. I have benefited from many\nyears of support from my parents, grandparents, and siblings. In\nparticular, I want my mom and dad to know that I love them. It is a\nspecial feeling to know that your parents are your greatest fans.\nThird, to my assistant, Lyndsey Nuckols. At this point, her job defies\ndescription as she has been asked to do nearly everything one could\nimagine for a small business. Thankfully, her skills and talents are\nmore powerful than my questionable management style. Some sections\nof this book are as much hers as they are mine. I am deeply grateful for\nher help.\nAs for the content and writing of the book, I have a long list of\npeople to thank. To start, there are a few people from whom I have\nlearned so much that it would be a crime to not mention them by\nname. Leo Babauta, Charles Duhigg, Nir Eyal, and BJ Fogg have each\ninfluenced my thoughts on habits in meaningful ways. Their work and\nideas can be found sprinkled throughout this text. If you enjoyed this\nbook, I’d encourage you to read their writing as well.\nAt various stages of writing, I benefited from the guidance of many\nfine editors. Thanks to Peter Guzzardi for walking me through the early\nstages of the writing process and for a kick in the pants when I really\nneeded it. I am indebted to Blake Atwood and Robin Dellabough for\ntransforming my ugly and insanely long first drafts into a tight,\nreadable manuscript. And I am thankful to Anne Barngrover for her\nability to add a little class and poetic style to my writing.\nI’d like to thank the many people who read early versions of the\nmanuscript, including Bruce Ammons, Darcey Ansell, Tim Ballard,\nVishal Bhardwaj, Charlotte Blank, Jerome Burt, Sim Campbell, Al\nCarlos, Nicky Case, Julie Chang, Jason Collins, Debra Croy, Roger\nDooley, Tiago Forte, Matt Gartland, Andrew Gierer, Randy Giffen, Jon\nGiganti, Adam Gilbert, Stephan Guyenet, Jeremy Hendon, Jane\nHorvath, Joakim Jansson, Josh Kaufman, Anne Kavanagh, Chris\nKlaus, Zeke Lopez, Cady Macon, Cyd Madsen, Kiera McGrath, Amy\nMitchell, Anna Moise, Stacey Morris, Tara-Nicholle Nelson, Taylor\nPearson, Max Shank, Trey Shelton, Jason Shen, Jacob Zangelidis, and\nAri Zelmanow. The book benefited greatly from your feedback.\nTo the team at Avery and Penguin Random House who made this\nbook a reality, thank you. I owe a debt of special thanks to my\npublisher, Megan Newman, for her endless patience as I continually\npushed back deadlines. She gave me the space I needed to create a\nbook I was proud of and championed my ideas at every step. To Nina,\nfor her ability to transform my writing while still retaining my original\nmessage. To Lindsay, Farin, Casey, and the rest of the PRH team for\nspreading the message of this book to more people than I could ever\nreach on my own. To Pete Garceau, for designing a beautiful cover for\nthis book.\nAnd to my agent, Lisa DiMona, for her guidance and insight at every\nstep of the publishing process.\nTo the many friends and family members who asked “How’s the\nbook going?” and offered a word of encouragement when I inevitably\nreplied “Slowly”—thank you. Every author faces a few dark moments\nwhen writing a book, and one kind word can be enough to get you to\nshow up again the next day.\nI am sure there are people I have forgotten, but I keep an updated\nlist of anyone who has influenced my thinking in meaningful ways at\njamesclear.com/thanks.\nAnd finally, to you. Life is short and you have shared some of your\nprecious time with me by reading this book. Thank you.\n—May 2018\nI\nNotes\nN THIS SECTION, I have included a detailed list of notes, references, and\ncitations for each chapter in the book. I trust that most readers will\nfind this list to be sufficient. However, I also realize that scientific\nliterature changes over time and the references for this book may need\nto be updated. Furthermore, I fully expect that I have made a mistake\nsomewhere in this book—either in attributing an idea to the wrong\nperson or not giving credit to someone where it is due. (If you believe\nthis to be the case, please email me at james@jamesclear.com so I can\nfix the issue as soon as possible.)\nIn addition to the notes below, you can find a full list of updated\nendnotes and corrections at atomichabits.com/endnotes.\nINTRODUCTION\nWe all deal with setbacks: What about luck, you might ask? Luck matters, certainly. Habits\nare not the only thing that influence your success, but they are probably the most\nimportant factor that is within your control.

But because it is exponential, the\nimprovement is actually 10x greater.” April 3, 2018.\nHabits are the compound interest: Many people have noted how habits multiply over\ntime. Here are some of my favorite articles and books on the subject: Leo Babauta, “The\nPower of Habit Investments,” Zen Habits, January 28, 2013,\nhttps://zenhabits.net/bank; Morgan Housel, “The Freakishly Strong Base,”\nCollaborative Fund, October 31, 2017, http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-\nfreakishly-strong-base; Darren Hardy, The Compound Effect (New York: Vanguard\nPress, 2012).\nAccomplishing one extra task: As Sam Altman says, “A small productivity gain,\ncompounded over 50 years, is worth a lot.” “Productivity,” Sam Altman. April 10, 2018,\nhttp://blog.samaltman.com/productivity.\nHabits are a double-edged sword: I’d like to credit Jason Hreha with originally describing\nhabits to me in this way. Jason Hreha (@jhreha), “They’re a double edged sword,”\nTwitter, February 21, 2018, https://twitter.com/jhreha/status/966430907371433984.\nThe more tasks you can handle without thinking: Michael (@mmay3r), “The\nfoundation of productivity is habits.

This effect compounds,” Twitter, April 10, 2018,\nhttps://twitter.com/mmay3r/status/983837519274889216.\neach book you read not only teaches: This idea—that learning new ideas increases the\nvalue of your old ideas—is something I first heard about from Patrick O’Shaughnessy,\nwho writes, “This is why knowledge compounds. Old stuff that was a 4/10 in value can\nbecome a 10/10, unlocked by another book in the future.”\nhttp://investorfieldguide.com/reading-tweet-storm.\nCancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable: “How to Live a Longer, Higher\nQuality Life, with Peter Attia, M.D.,” Investor’s Field Guide, March 7, 2017,\nhttp://investorfieldguide.com/attia.\nThe San Antonio Spurs: Matt Moore, “NBA Finals: A Rock, Hammer and Cracking of\nSpurs’ Majesty in Game 7,” CBS Sports, June 21, 2013,\nhttps://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-finals-a-rock-hammer-and-cracking-of-\nspurs-majesty-in-game-7.\nInspiration for this drawing came from a tweet titled “Deception of linear vs exponential” by\n@MlichaelW. May 19, 2018.\nhttps://twitter.com/MlichaelW/status/997878086132817920.\nThe seed of every habit: This paragraph was inspired by a quote from Mr. Mircea, an\naccount on Twitter, who wrote, “each habit began its life as a single decision.”\nhttps://twitter.com/mistermircea.\nthe goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers: Hat tip to\nCrossFit coach Ben Bergeron for inspiring this quote during a conversation I had with\nhim on February 28, 2017.\nYou fall to the level of your systems: This line was inspired by the following quote from\nArchilochus: “We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our\ntraining.”\nCHAPTER 2\nYou can imagine them like the layers of an onion: Hat tip to Simon Sinek. His “Golden\nCircle” framework is similar in design, but discusses different topics. For more, see\nSimon Sinek, Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action\n(London: Portfolio/Penguin, 2013), 37.\nI resolved to stop chewing my nails: The quotes used in this section are presented as a\nconversation for reading clarity, but were originally written by Clark. See: Brian Clark,\n“The Powerful Psychological Boost that Helps You Make and Break Habits,” Further,\nNovember 14, 2017, https://further.net/pride-habits.\nResearch has shown that once a person: Christopher J.

Also, thanks to Tamar Shippony, a reader of\njamesclear.com, who originally told me about the etymology of the word identity, which\nshe looked up in the American Heritage Dictionary.\nWe change bit by bit: This is another reason atomic habits are such an effective form of\nchange. If you change your identity too quickly and become someone radically different\novernight, then you feel as if you lose your sense of self. But if you update and expand\nyour identity gradually, you will find yourself reborn into someone totally new and yet\nstill familiar. Slowly—habit by habit, vote by vote—you become accustomed to your new\nidentity. Atomic habits and gradual improvement are the keys to identity change\nwithout identity loss.\nCHAPTER 3\nEdward Thorndike conducted an experiment: Peter Gray, Psychology, 6th ed.

It’s probably a paraphrase of this\npassage: “The psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made\nconscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains\nundivided and does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must perforce\nact out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves.” For more, see C.

For this idea, I give credit to BJ Fogg. In his work,\nFogg uses the term anchoring to describe this approach because your old habit acts as\nan “anchor” that keeps the new one in place.

The precise placement of\nthe electrode was largely happenstance; at the time, the geography of the mind\nremained a mystery. But Olds and Milner got lucky. They inserted the needle right next\nto the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a part of the brain that generates pleasurable feelings.\nWhenever you eat a piece of chocolate cake, or listen to a favorite pop song, or watch\nyour favorite team win the World Series, it is your NAcc that helps you feel so happy.\nBut Olds and Milner quickly discovered that too much pleasure can be fatal. They placed\nthe electrodes in several rodents’ brains and then ran a small current into each wire,\nmaking the NAccs continually excited. The scientists noticed that the rodents lost\ninterest in everything. They stopped eating and drinking. All courtship behavior ceased.\nThe rats would just huddle in the corners of their cages, transfixed by their bliss. Within\ndays, all of the animals had perished. They died of thirst.

Its real-world\norigin was as a gambit employed by photographer Jerry Uelsmann to motivate his\nBeginning Photography students at the University of Florida. As retold in ‘Art & Fear’ it\nfaithfully captures the scene as Jerry told it to me—except I replaced photography with\nceramics as the medium being explored. Admittedly, it would’ve been easier to retain\nphotography as the art medium being discussed, but David Bayles (co-author) & I are\nboth photographers ourselves, and at the time we were consciously trying to broaden\nthe range of media being referenced in the text. The intriguing thing to me is that it\nhardly matters what art form was invoked—the moral of the story appears to hold\nequally true straight across the whole art spectrum (and even outside the arts, for that\nmatter).” Later in that same email, Orland said, “You have our permission to reprint any\nor all of the ‘ceramics’ passage in your forthcoming book.” In the end, I settled on\npublishing an adapted version, which combines their telling of the ceramics story with\nfacts from the original source of Uelsmann’s photography students.

The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are\ngoing to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it\nonly does so as the unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater\nthan oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.” For\nmore, see Viktor E. Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning: An Introduction to\nLogotherapy (Boston: Beacon Press, 1962).\n“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how”: Friedrich Nietzsche and\nOscar Levy, The Twilight of the Idols (Edinburgh: Foulis, 1909).\nThe feeling comes first (System 1): Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (New\nYork: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2015).\nappealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason: “If you\nwish to persuade, appeal to interest, rather than reason” (Benjamin Franklin).\nSatisfaction = Liking − Wanting: This is similar to David Meister’s fifth law of service\nbusinesses: Satisfaction = perception − expectation.\n“Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more”: Lucius Annaeus Seneca and\nAnna Lydia Motto, Moral Epistles (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1985).\nAs Aristotle noted: It is debated whether Aristotle actually said this.

You can see my thoughts\nat atomichabits.com/cycling.\n* I geeked out and actually calculated this. Washington, D.C.,\nis about 225 miles from New York City. Assuming you are\nflying on a 747 or an Airbus A380, changing the heading by\n3.5 degrees as you leave Los Angeles likely causes the nose of\nthe airplane to shift between 7.2 to 7.6 feet, or about 86 to 92\ninches. A very small shift in direction can lead to a very\nmeaningful change in destination.\n* The terms unconscious, nonconscious, and subconscious\ncan all be used to describe the absence of awareness or\nthought. Even in academic circles, these words are often used\ninterchangeably without much nitpicking (for once).\nNonconscious is the term I’m going to use because it is broad\nenough to encompass both the processes of the mind we\ncould never consciously access and the moments when we are\nsimply not paying attention to what surrounds us.\nNonconscious is a description of anything you are not\nconsciously thinking about.\n* Certainly, there are some aspects of your identity that tend\nto remain unchanged over time—like identifying as someone\nwho is tall or short. But even for more fixed qualities and\ncharacteristics, whether you view them in a positive or\nnegative light is determined by your experiences throughout\nlife.\n* Readers of The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg will\nrecognize these terms. Duhigg wrote a great book and my\nintention is to pick up where he left off by integrating these\nstages into four simple laws you can apply to build better\nhabits in life and work.\n* Charles Duhigg and Nir Eyal deserve special recognition for\ntheir influence on this image. This representation of the habit\nloop is a combination of language that was popularized by\nDuhigg’s book, The Power of Habit, and a design that was\npopularized by Eyal’s book, Hooked.\n* When I visited Japan, I saw this strategy save a woman’s\nlife. Her young son stepped onto the Shinkansen, one of\nJapan’s famous bullet trains that travel at over two hundred\nmiles per hour, just as the doors were closing. She was left\noutside on the platform and jammed her arm through the\ndoor to grab him. With her arm stuck in the door, the train\nwas about to take off, but right before it pulled away an\nemployee performed a safety check by Pointing-and-Calling\nup and down the platform. In less than five seconds, he\nnoticed the woman and managed to stop the train from\nleaving. The door opened, the woman—now in tears—ran to\nher son, and a minute later the train departed safely.\n* Interested readers can get a template to create their own\nHabits Scorecard at atomichabits.com/scorecard.\n* In addition to her payment for the library, Catherine the\nGreat asked Diderot to keep the books until she needed them\nand offered to pay him a yearly salary to act as her librarian.\n* Fogg refers to this strategy as the “Tiny Habits recipe,” but\nI’ll call it the habit stacking formula throughout the book.\n* If you’re looking for more examples and guidance, you can\ndownload a Habit Stacking template at\natomichabits.com/habitstacking.\n* Dopamine is not the only chemical that influences your\nhabits. Every behavior involves multiple brain regions and\nneurochemicals, and anyone who claims that “habits are all\nabout dopamine” is skipping over major portions of the\nprocess. It is just one of the important role players in habit\nformation. However, I will single out the dopamine circuit in\nthis chapter because it provides a window into the biological\nunderpinnings of desire, craving, and motivation that are\nbehind every habit.\n* I’m so happy I was able to fit a Game of Thrones reference\ninto this book.\n* This is just a partial list of underlying motives. I offer a\nmore complete list and more examples of how to apply them\nto business at atomichabits.com/business.\n* A similar story is told in the book Art & Fear by David\nBayles and Ted Orland. It has been adapted here with\npermission. See the endnotes for a full explanation.\n* This is a foundational principle in physics, where it is\nknown as the Principle of Least Action. It states that the path\nfollowed between any two points will always be the path\nrequiring the least energy. This simple principle underpins\nthe laws of the universe. From this one idea, you can describe\nthe laws of motion and relativity.\n* The phrase addition by subtraction is also used by teams\nand businesses to describe removing people from a group in\norder to make the team stronger overall.\n* To be fair, this still sounds like an amazing night.\n* I designed a habit journal specifically to make journaling\neasier. It includes a “One Line Per Day” section where you\nsimply write one sentence about your day. You can learn\nmore at atomichabits.com/journal.\n* The irony of how closely this story matches my process of\nwriting this book is not lost on me. Although my publisher\nwas much more accommodating, and my closet remained\nfull, I did feel like I had to place myself on house arrest to\nfinish the manuscript.\n* This is also referred to as a “Ulysses pact” or a “Ulysses\ncontract.” Named after Ulysses, the hero of The Odyssey, who\ntold his sailors to tie him to the mast of the ship so that he\ncould hear the enchanting song of the Sirens but wouldn’t be\nable to steer the ship toward them and crash on the rocks.\nUlysses realized the benefits of locking in your future actions\nwhile your mind is in the right place rather than waiting to\nsee where your desires take you in the moment.\n* The shift to a delayed-return environment likely began\naround the advent of agriculture ten thousand years ago\nwhen farmers began planting crops in anticipation of a\nharvest months later. However, it was not until recent\ncenturies that our lives became filled with delayed-return\nchoices: career planning, retirement planning, vacation\nplanning, and everything else that occupies our calendars.\n* Time inconsistency is also referred to as hyperbolic\ndiscounting.\n* This can derail our decision making as well. The brain\noverestimates the danger of anything that seems like an\nimmediate threat but has almost no likelihood of actually\noccurring: your plane crashing during a bit of turbulence, a\nburglar breaking in while you’re home alone, a terrorist\nblowing up the bus you’re on. Meanwhile, it underestimates\nwhat appears to be a distant threat but is actually very likely:\nthe steady accumulation of fat from eating unhealthy food,\nthe gradual decay of your muscles from sitting at a desk, the\nslow creep of clutter when you fail to tidy up.\n* Interested readers can find a habit tracker template at\natomichabits.com/tracker.\n* You can see the actual Habit Contracts used by Bryan\nHarris and get a blank template at\natomichabits.com/contract.\n* If you are interested in taking a personality test, you can\nfind links to the most reliable tests here:\natomichabits.com/personality.\n* If it’s Harry Potter on repeat, I feel you.\n* I have a pet theory about what happens when we achieve a\nflow state. This isn’t confirmed. It’s just my guess.\nPsychologists commonly refer to the brain as operating in two\nmodes: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast and\ninstinctual. Generally speaking, processes you can perform\nvery quickly (like habits) are governed by System 1.\nMeanwhile, System 2 controls thinking processes that are\nmore effortful and slow—like calculating the answer to a\ndifficult math problem. With regard to flow, I like to imagine\nSystem 1 and System 2 as residing on opposite ends of the\nspectrum of thinking. The more automatic a cognitive process\nis, the more it slides toward the System 1 side of the\nspectrum. The more effortful a task is, the more it slides\ntoward System 2. Flow, I believe, resides on the razor’s edge\nbetween System 1 and System 2. You are fully using all of\nyour automatic and implicit knowledge related to the task\nwhile also working hard to rise to a challenge beyond your\nability. Both brain modes are fully engaged. The conscious\nand nonconscious are working perfectly in sync.\n* The discovery of variable rewards happened by accident.\nOne day in the lab, the famous Harvard psychologist B. F.\nSkinner was running low on food pellets during one\nexperiment and making more was a time-consuming process\nbecause he had to manually press the pellets in a machine.\nThis situation led him to “ask myself why every press of the\nlever had to be reinforced.” He decided to only give treats to\nthe rats intermittently and, to his surprise, varying the\ndelivery of food did not decrease behavior, but actually\nincreased it.\n* I created a template for readers interested in keeping a\ndecision journal. It is included as part of the habit journal at\natomichabits.com/journal.\n* You can see my previous Annual Reviews at\njamesclear.com/annual-review.\n* You can see my previous Integrity Reports at\njamesclear.com/integrity.\n* Sorites is derived from the Greek word sorós, which means\nheap or pile.\n
