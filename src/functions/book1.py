As my classmate took a full swing, the\nbat slipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking\nme directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of\nimpact.\nThe bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my\nnose into a distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my\nbrain slamming into the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of\nswelling surged throughout my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a\nbroken nose, multiple skull fractures, and two shattered eye sockets.\nWhen I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running\nover to help. I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes.\nOne of my classmates took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I\nused it to plug the stream of blood rushing from my broken nose.\nShocked and confused, I was unaware of how seriously I had been\ninjured.\nMy teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the\nlong walk to the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back\ninto school. Random hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We\ntook our time and walked slowly. Nobody realized that every minute\nmattered.\nWhen we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of\nquestions.\n“What year is it?”\n“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.\n“Who is the president of the United States?”\n“Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.\n“What is your mom’s name?”\n“Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.\n“Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten\nseconds to remember my own mother’s name.\nThat is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle\nthe rapid swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the\nambulance arrived. Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken\nto the local hospital.\nShortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled\nwith basic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first\nseizure of the day. Then I stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors\nhurried to supply me with oxygen, they also decided the local hospital\nwas unequipped to handle the situation and ordered a helicopter to fly\nme to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.\nI was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the\nhelipad across the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as\none nurse pushed me along while another pumped each breath into me\nby hand. My mother, who had arrived at the hospital a few moments\nbefore, climbed into the helicopter beside me. I remained unconscious\nand unable to breathe on my own as she held my hand during the\nflight.\nWhile my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my father went\nhome to check on my brother and sister and break the news to them.\nHe choked back tears as he explained to my sister that he would miss\nher eighth-grade graduation ceremony that night. After passing my\nsiblings off to family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my\nmother.\nWhen my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of\nnearly twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and\nwheeled me into the trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain\nhad become so severe that I was having repeated post-traumatic\nseizures. My broken bones needed to be fixed, but I was in no\ncondition to undergo surgery. After yet another seizure—my third of\nthe day—I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a\nventilator.\nMy parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier,\nthey had entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister\nwas diagnosed with leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My\nbrother was just six months old. After two and a half years of\nchemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone marrow biopsies, my\nlittle sister finally walked out of the hospital happy, healthy, and\ncancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents found\nthemselves back in the same place with a different child.\nWhile I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social\nworker to comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met\nwith them a decade earlier on the evening they found out my sister had\ncancer.\nAs day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My\nparents slept restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they\nwould collapse from fatigue, the next they would be wide awake with\nworry. My mother would tell me later, “It was one of the worst nights\nI’ve ever had.”\nMY RECOVERY\nMercifully, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the\npoint where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma.\nWhen I finally regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my\nability to smell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniff\nan apple juice box. My sense of smell returned, but—to everyone’s\nsurprise—the act of blowing my nose forced air through the fractures\nin my eye socket and pushed my left eye outward. My eyeball bulged\nout of the socket, held precariously in place by my eyelid and the optic\nnerve attaching my eye to my brain.\nThe ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into\nplace as the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would\ntake. I was scheduled for surgery one week later, which would allow me\nsome additional time to heal. I looked like I had been on the wrong end\nof a boxing match, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I returned\nhome with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a bulging\nleft eye.\nThe following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life\nwas on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn’t see\nstraight. It took more than a month, but my eyeball did eventually\nreturn to its normal location. Between the seizures and my vision\nproblems, it was eight months before I could drive a car again. At\nphysical therapy, I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in a\nstraight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me down, but\nthere were more than a few moments when I felt depressed and\noverwhelmed.\nI became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to\nthe baseball field one year later. Baseball had always been a major part\nof my life. My dad had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis\nCardinals, and I had a dream of playing professionally, too. After\nmonths of rehabilitation, what I wanted more than anything was to get\nback on the field.\nBut my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled\naround, I was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. I\nwas sent down to play with the sophomores on junior varsity. I had\nbeen playing since age four, and for someone who had spent so much\ntime and effort on the sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividly\nremember the day it happened. I sat in my car and cried as I flipped\nthrough the radio, desperately searching for a song that would make\nme feel better.\nAfter a year of self-doubt, I managed to make the varsity team as a\nsenior, but I rarely made it on the field. In total, I played eleven\ninnings of high school varsity baseball, barely more than a single game.\nDespite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I could\nbecome a great player. And I knew that if things were going to\nimprove, I was the one responsible for making it happen. The turning\npoint came two years after my injury, when I began college at Denison\nUniversity. It was a new beginning, and it was the place where I would\ndiscover the surprising power of small habits for the first time.\nHOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS\nAttending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned a\nspot on the baseball team and, although I was at the bottom of the\nroster as a freshman, I was thrilled. Despite the chaos of my high\nschool years, I had managed to become a college athlete.\nI wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I\nfocused on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and\nplayed video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early\neach night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to\nkeep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but\nthey gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident\nagain. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the classroom as I\nimproved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s during my\nfirst year.\nA habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in\nmany cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated\nsmall but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were\nunimaginable to me when I started. For example, for the first time in\nmy life, I made it a habit to lift weights multiple times per week, and in\nthe years that followed, my six-foot-four-inch frame bulked up from a\nfeatherweight 170 to a lean 200 pounds.\nWhen my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on the\npitching staff. By my junior year, I was voted team captain and at the\nend of the season, I was selected for the all-conference team. But it was\nnot until my senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, and\nstrength-training habits really began to pay off.\nSix years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown to\nthe hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male\nathlete at Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-\nAmerica Team—an honor given to just thirty-three players across the\ncountry. By the time I graduated, I was listed in the school record\nbooks in eight different categories. That same year, I was awarded the\nuniversity’s highest academic honor, the President’s Medal.\nI hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, there\nwas nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I never\nended up playing professionally. However, looking back on those\nyears, I believe I accomplished something just as rare: I fulfilled my\npotential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfill\nyour potential as well.\nWe all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the\nexperience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and\nunimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re\nwilling to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the\nlong run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our\nhabits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But\nwith better habits, anything is possible.\nMaybe there are people who can achieve incredible success\novernight. I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them.\nThere wasn’t one defining moment on my journey from medically\ninduced coma to Academic All-American; there were many. It was a\ngradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs.\nThe only way I made progress—the only choice I had—was to start\nsmall. And I employed this same strategy a few years later when I\nstarted my own business and began working on this book.\nHOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK\nIn November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. For\nyears, I had been keeping notes about my personal experiments with\nhabits and I was finally ready to share some of them publicly. I began\nby publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a few\nmonths, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email\nsubscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to more\nthan thirty thousand people.\nIn 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand\nsubscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on\nthe internet. I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years\nearlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits—a new\nlabel that excited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had never\nconsidered myself a master of the topic, but rather someone who was\nexperimenting alongside my readers.\nIn 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and\nsigned a book deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the\nbook you are reading now. As my audience grew, so did my business\nopportunities. I was increasingly asked to speak at top companies\nabout the science of habit formation, behavior change, and continuous\nimprovement. I found myself delivering keynote speeches at\nconferences in the United States and Europe.\nIn 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publications\nlike Time, Entrepreneur, and Forbes. Incredibly, my writing was read\nby over eight million people that year. Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and\nMLB began reading my work and sharing it with their teams.\nAt the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy, which became\nthe premier training platform for organizations and individuals\ninterested in building better habits in life and work.* Fortune 500\ncompanies and growing start-ups began to enroll their leaders and\ntrain their staff. In total, over ten thousand leaders, managers,\ncoaches, and teachers have graduated from the Habits Academy, and\nmy work with them has taught me an incredible amount about what it\ntakes to make habits work in the real world.\nAs I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.com\nis receiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundred\nthousand people subscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number\nthat is so far beyond my expectations when I began that I’m not even\nsure what to think of it.\nHOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOU\nThe entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a\ngreat book, you must first become the book.” I originally learned about\nthe ideas mentioned here because I had to live them. I had to rely on\nsmall habits to rebound from my injury, to get stronger in the gym, to\nperform at a high level on the field, to become a writer, to build a\nsuccessful business, and simply to develop into a responsible adult.\nSmall habits helped me fulfill my potential, and since you picked up\nthis book, I’m guessing you’d like to fulfill yours as well.\nIn the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for building\nbetter habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While science\nsupports everything I’ve written, this book is not an academic research\npaper; it’s an operating manual. You’ll find wisdom and practical\nadvice front and center as I explain the science of how to create and\nchange your habits in a way that is easy to understand and apply.\nThe fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy,\npsychology, and more—have been around for many years. What I offer\nyou is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time\nago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made\nrecently. My contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most\nand connect them in a way that is highly actionable. Anything wise in\nthese pages you should credit to the many experts who preceded me.\nAnything foolish, assume it is my error.\nThe backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue,\ncraving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change\nthat evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background\nmay recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which\nwas first proposed as “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in\nthe 1930s and has been popularized more recently as “cue, routine,\nreward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.\nBehavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the\nright reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain\nway. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how\nexternal stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for\nhow our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal\nstates—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades,\nscientists have begun to determine the connection between our\nthoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in\nthese pages.\nIn total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the\ncognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models\nof human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of\nexternal stimuli and internal emotions on our habits. While some of\nthe language may be familiar, I am confident that the details—and the\napplications of the Four Laws of Behavior Change—will offer a new\nway to think about your habits.\nHuman behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment\nto moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t\nchange. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting\nprinciples you can rely on year after year. The ideas you can build a\nbusiness around, build a family around, build a life around.\nThere is no one right way to create better habits, but this book\ndescribes the best way I know—an approach that will be effective\nregardless of where you start or what you’re trying to change. The\nstrategies I cover will be relevant to anyone looking for a step-by-step\nsystem for improvement, whether your goals center on health, money,\nproductivity, relationships, or all of the above. As long as human\nbehavior is involved, this book will be your guide.\nTHE \nFUNDAMENTALS\nWhy Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference\nT\n1\nThe Surprising Power of Atomic Habits\nHE FATE OF British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The\norganization, which was the governing body for professional\ncycling in Great Britain, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new\nperformance director. At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain\nhad endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity. Since 1908,\nBritish riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games,\nand they had fared even worse in cycling’s biggest race, the Tour de\nFrance. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.\nIn fact, the performance of British riders had been so\nunderwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe\nrefused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would\nhurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear.\nBrailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory.\nWhat made him different from previous coaches was his relentless\ncommitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of\nmarginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny\nmargin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “The\nwhole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything\nyou could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1\npercent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all\ntogether.”\nBrailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you\nmight expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the\nbike seats to make them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the\ntires for a better grip. They asked riders to wear electrically heated\novershorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and used\nbiofeedback sensors to monitor how each athlete responded to a\nparticular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel\nand had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which\nproved to be lighter and more aerodynamic.\nBut they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find\n1 percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They\ntested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest\nmuscle recovery. They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way\nto wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. They\ndetermined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night’s\nsleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team truck\nwhite, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally\nslip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely\ntuned bikes.\nAs these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated,\nthe results came faster than anyone could have imagined.\nJust five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team\ndominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic\nGames in Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the\ngold medals available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games came\nto London, the Brits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records\nand seven world records.\nThat same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to\nwin the Tour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froome\nwon the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017,\ngiving the British team five Tour de France victories in six years.\nDuring the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won\n178 world championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold\nmedals and captured five Tour de France victories in what is widely\nregarded as the most successful run in cycling history.*\nHow does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary\nathletes transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at\nfirst glance, would seem to make a modest difference at best? Why do\nsmall improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and\nhow can you replicate this approach in your own life?\nWHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE\nIt is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment\nand underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily\nbasis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires\nmassive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business,\nwriting a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal,\nwe put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering\nimprovement that everyone will talk about.\nMeanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—\nsometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful,\nespecially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make\nover time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get\n1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times\nbetter by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse\neach day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts\nas a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much\nmore.\n1% BETTER EVERY DAY\n1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03\n1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78\nFIGURE 1: The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if\nyou can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are\nnearly 37 times better after one year.\nHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same\nway that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of\nyour habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little\ndifference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the\nmonths and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two,\nfive, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the\ncost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.\nThis can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often\ndismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in\nthe moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a\nmillionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of\nshape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t\nlearned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never\nseem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.\nUnfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to\nlet a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale\ndoesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family,\nthey will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until\ntomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision\nis easy to dismiss.\nBut when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating\npoor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little\nexcuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the\naccumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—\nthat eventually leads to a problem.\nThe impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect\nof shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you\nare flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from\nLAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in\nWashington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely\nnoticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—\nbut when magnified across the entire United States, you end up\nhundreds of miles apart.*\nSimilarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a\nvery different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1\npercent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of\nmoments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the\ndifference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the\nproduct of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\nThat said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are\nright now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the\npath toward success. You should be far more concerned with your\ncurrent trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire\nbut you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad\ntrajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to end\nwell. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month,\nthen you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re\nmoving slower than you’d like.\nYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth\nis a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging\nmeasure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of\nyour learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning\nhabits. You get what you repeat.\nIf you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do\nis follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily\nchoices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you\nspending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the\ngym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new\neach day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your\nfuture self.\nTime magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will\nmultiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad\nhabits make time your enemy.\nHabits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just\nas easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding\nthe details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to\ndesign them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the\nblade.\nYOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU\nPositive Compounding\nProductivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day,\nbut it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or mastering\na new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more\nyour brain is free to focus on other areas.\nKnowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a\ncommitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not\nonly teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old\nideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound\ninterest.”\nRelationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help\nothers, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result\nin a network of broad and strong connections over time.\nNegative Compounding\nStress compounds. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities.\nThe worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves,\nthese common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little\nstresses compound into serious health issues.\nNegative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly,\nthe more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop.\nThe same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people\nas angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.\nOutrage compounds. Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a single\nevent. Instead, a long series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until\none event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire.\nWHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE\nImagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you.\nThe room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-\nfive degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.\nTwenty-six degrees.\nTwenty-seven.\nTwenty-eight.\nThe ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.\nTwenty-nine degrees.\nThirty.\nThirty-one.\nStill, nothing has happened.\nThen, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift,\nseemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has\nunlocked a huge change.\nBreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous\nactions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major\nchange. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent\nof its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo\ncan barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root\nsystems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within\nsix weeks.\nSimilarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross\na critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early\nand middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of\nDisappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and\nit’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,\nweeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere.\nIt’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful\noutcomes are delayed.\nThis is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that\nlast. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and\ndecide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so\nwhy can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking\ntakes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order\nto make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to\nbreak through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.\nIf you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad\none, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often\nbecause you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.\nComplaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like\ncomplaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from\ntwenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just\nbeing stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.\nWhen you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential,\npeople will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the\nmost dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that\nit’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t\nmaking any progress—that makes the jump today possible.\nIt is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic\nplates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension\nslowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once\nagain, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension\nis too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it\nhappens all at once.\nMastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most\nsuccessful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer\nJacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help,\nI go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a\nhundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the\nhundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that\nlast blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”\nTHE PLATEAU OF LATENT POTENTIAL\nFIGURE 2: We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope\nit will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is\nnot until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous\nwork we have done. This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where\npeople feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work\nwithout experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was\nsimply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous\nefforts is revealed.\nAll big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit\nis a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit\nsprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches\ngrow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak\nwithin us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a\ndelicate flower one day at a time.\nBut what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to\nsurvive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other\nside? What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits\nand enables others to enjoy the compounding effects of good ones?\nFORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD\nPrevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in\nlife—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing\nmore and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—\nis to set specific, actionable goals.\nFor many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one\nwas a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in\nschool, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I\nwanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of\nthem. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do\nwith the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I\nfollowed.\nWhat’s the difference between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I\nfirst learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert\ncomic. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are\nabout the processes that lead to those results.\nIf you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your\nsystem is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant\ncoaches, and conduct practice.\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-\ndollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire\nemployees, and run marketing campaigns.\nIf you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your\nsystem is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle\ndifficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from\nyour instructor.\nNow for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your\ngoals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For\nexample, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to\nwin a championship and focused only on what your team does at\npractice each day, would you still get results?\nI think you would.\nThe goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be\nridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only\nway to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time\nSuper Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The\nsame is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then\nforget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.\nWhat do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course\nnot. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for\nmaking progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too\nmuch time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing\nyour systems.\nProblem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.\nGoal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We\nconcentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and\nmistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while\noverlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t\nsucceed.\nEvery Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants\nto get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the\nsame goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners\nfrom the losers. It wasn’t the goal of winning the Tour de France that\npropelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they\nhad wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other\nprofessional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when\nthey implemented a system of continuous small improvements that\nthey achieved a different outcome.\nProblem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you\nsummon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for\nnow. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a\nmessy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of\nclutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing\nthe same outcome because you never changed the system behind it.\nYou treated a symptom without addressing the cause.\nAchieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the\ncounterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to\nchange our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really\nneed to change are the systems that cause those results. When you\nsolve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In\norder to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems\nlevel. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.\nProblem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.\nThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal,\nthen I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that\nyou’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I’ve\nslipped into this trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years,\nhappiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I\npromised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after\nmy business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally\nrelax.\nFurthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve\nyour goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.\nYou mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is\nmisguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match\nthe exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense\nto restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths\nto success.\nA systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in\nlove with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to\ngive yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime\nyour system is running. And a system can be successful in many\ndifferent forms, not just the one you first envision.\nProblem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.\nFinally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many\nrunners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line,\nthey stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When\nall of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to\npush you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find\nthemselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.\nThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of\nbuilding systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term\nthinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single\naccomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and\ncontinuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the\nprocess that will determine your progress.\nA SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS\nIf you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you.\nThe problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and\nagain not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the\nwrong system for change.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your\nsystems.\nFocusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of\nthe core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings\nbehind the word atomic. By now, you’ve probably realized that an\natomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent\nimprovement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however\nsmall. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as\natoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the\nbuilding blocks of remarkable results.\nHabits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental\nunit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny\nroutines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel\nbigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of\ntheir initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the\nmeaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine\nthat is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible\npower; a component of the system of compound growth.\nChapter Summary\nHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1\npercent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\nHabits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or\nagainst you, which is why understanding the details is essential.\nSmall changes often appear to make no difference until you cross\na critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any\ncompounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.\nAn atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just\nas atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are\nthe building blocks of remarkable results.\nIf you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus\non your system instead.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of\nyour systems.\nW\n2\nHow Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and\nVice Versa)\nHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good\nones? Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life\nthan improving your daily habits. And yet it is likely that this time next\nyear you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better.\nIt often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few\ndays, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.\nHabits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are\nreasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.\nHowever, once your habits are established, they seem to stick\naround forever—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best\nintentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much\ntelevision, procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.\nChanging our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to\nchange the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the\nwrong way. In this chapter, I’ll address the first point. In the chapters\nthat follow, I’ll answer the second.\nOur first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To\nunderstand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which\nchange can occur. You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.\nTHREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE\nFIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your\noutcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.\nThe first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is\nconcerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a\nbook, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are\nassociated with this level of change.\nThe second layer is changing your process. This level is\nconcerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a\nnew routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow,\ndeveloping a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are\nassociated with this level.\nThe third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This\nlevel is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your\nself-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the\nbeliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.\nOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do.\nIdentity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habits\nthat last—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent\nimprovements—the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse”\nthan another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. The\nproblem is the direction of change.\nMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing\non what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits.\nThe alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach,\nwe start by focusing on who we wish to become.\nOUTCOME-BASED HABITS\nIDENTITY-BASED HABITS\nFIGURE 4: With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to\nachieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to\nbecome.\nImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the\nfirst person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a\nreasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker\nwho is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will\nchange while carrying around the same beliefs.\nThe second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a\nsmoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in\nidentity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one.\nThey no longer identify as someone who smokes.\nMost people don’t even consider identity change when they set out\nto improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I\nstick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and\ndetermine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without\nconsidering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the\nway they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old\nidentity can sabotage their new plans for change.\nBehind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of\na democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and\nsocial equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of\nbeliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imagine\nmany ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such\nbehavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship.\nThat’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is\nimpossible under a certain set of beliefs.\nA similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals,\norganizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions\nthat shape the system, an identity behind the habits.\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may\nwant more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes\nrather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending\nrather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to\nprioritize comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing\nrather than training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never\nchange the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have\na new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.\nThe story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado,\nprovides a good example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed\nmy fingernails,” Clark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I\nwas young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual.\nOne day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.\nThrough mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”\nThen, Clark did something surprising.\n“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said. “My\nthought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t\nchew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What\nhappened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the\nfirst time. The manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I\nhad really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my\nfingernails. And even though that’s something I had never aspired to, it\nmade all the difference. I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a\nsingle close call. And it’s because I now take pride in properly caring\nfor them.”\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes\npart of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who\nwants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person\nwho is this.\nThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the\nmore motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If\nyou’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to\ncare for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps,\nyou’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re\nproud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours\nknitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth\nand nail to maintain your habits.\nTrue behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit\nbecause of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that\nit becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to\nvisit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the\nbelief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term\nchanges. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of\nwho you are.\nThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.\nThe goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.\nThe goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a\nmusician.\nYour behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do\nis an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either\nconsciously or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a\nperson believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more\nlikely to act in alignment with that belief. For example, people who\nidentified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than those who\nsimply claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to perform.\nSimilarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity\ndoesn’t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is\neasy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned,\nyou are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like\nthe type of person you already believe yourself to be.\nLike all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged\nsword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force\nfor self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity\nchange can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be\neasy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many\npeople walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the\nnorms attached to their identity.\n“I’m terrible with directions.”\n“I’m not a morning person.”\n“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”\n“I’m always late.”\n“I’m not good with technology.”\n“I’m horrible at math.”\n. . . and a thousand other variations.\nWhen you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to\nslide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you\nbegin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is\ninternal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that\nis consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid\ncontradicting yourself.\nThe more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the\nmore difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what\nyour culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-\nimage (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to\npositive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity\nconflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with\nyour identity, you will fail to put them into action.\nOn any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re\ntoo busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons.\nOver the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits\nis that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too\nattached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning.\nBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit\nyour beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\nThis brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and\nworldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they\ncome from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed?\nAnd how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve\nyou and gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?\nTHE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset\nbeliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and\nconditioned through experience.*\nMore precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity.\nWhen you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an\norganized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity\nof a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity\nof an athletic person.\nThe more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity\nassociated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally\nderived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and\nidentidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your\n“repeated beingness.”\nWhatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you\nhave proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you\nhave evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour\nevery night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the\ngym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed\nto fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly\nyou will believe it.\nFor most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a writer. If you\nwere to ask any of my high school teachers or college professors, they\nwould tell you I was an average writer at best: certainly not a standout.\nWhen I began my writing career, I published a new article every\nMonday and Thursday for the first few years. As the evidence grew, so\ndid my identity as a writer. I didn’t start out as a writer. I became one\nthrough my habits.\nOf course, your habits are not the only actions that influence your\nidentity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most\nimportant ones. Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but\nit’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you\nkicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you\nrepeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-\nimage begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade\naway while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means\nyour habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.\nIn this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of\nbecoming yourself.\nThis is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our\nfingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit,\nday by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing\nmicroevolutions of the self.\nEach habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you\nfinish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes\nreading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person\nwho likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are\nthe type of person who likes music.\nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to\nbecome. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes\nbuild up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason\nwhy meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits\ncan make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new\nidentity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the\nparadox of making small improvements.\nPutting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to\nchanging your identity. The most practical way to change who you are\nis to change what you do.\nEach time you write a page, you are a writer.\nEach time you practice the violin, you are a musician.\nEach time you start a workout, you are an athlete.\nEach time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.\nEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far\nmore important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually\naccomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence\nbegins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.\nOf course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to\nperform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that\nyou don’t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be votes\nfor both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election;\nyou just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a\nbad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the\nmajority of the time.\nNew identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same\nvotes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve\nalways had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.\nIt is a simple two-step process:\n1. Decide the type of person you want to be.\n2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\nFirst, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an\nindividual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want\nto stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to\nbecome?\nThese are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to begin\n—but they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack abs\nor to feel less anxious or to double their salary. That’s fine. Start there\nand work backward from the results you want to the type of person\nwho could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person\nthat could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person that\ncould lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn a\nnew language? Who is the type of person that could run a successful\nstart-up?\nFor example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?”\nIt’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus\nshifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person\nwho is consistent and reliable (identity-based).\nThis process can lead to beliefs like:\n“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.”\n“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and\nempathy they need.”\n“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”\nOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you\ncan begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a\nfriend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a\nhealthy person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a\nguide. Would a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy\nperson order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthy\nperson long enough, eventually she would become that person. She\nwas right.\nThe concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to\nanother key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape\nyour identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way\nstreet. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will\nexplore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your\nvalues, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.\nThe focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not\ngetting a particular outcome.\nTHE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER\nIdentity change is the North Star of habit change. The remainder of\nthis book will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to\nbuild better habits in yourself, your family, your team, your company,\nand anywhere else you wish. But the true question is: “Are you\nbecoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not\nwhat or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.\nOtherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And\nthat’s why we are starting here.\nYou have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your\nidentity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You\ncan choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you\nchoose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book\nand the real reason habits matter.\nBuilding better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks.\nIt’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower\neach morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about\nachieving external measures of success like earning more money,\nlosing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of\nthese things, but fundamentally they are not about having something.\nThey are about becoming someone.\nUltimately, your habits matter because they help you become the\ntype of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you\ndevelop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become\nyour habits.\nChapter Summary\nThere are three levels of change: outcome change, process change,\nand identity change.\nThe most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on\nwhat you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for\nthe type of person you wish to become.\nBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to\ncontinuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your\nidentity.\nThe real reason habits matter is not because they can get you\nbetter results (although they can do that), but because they can\nchange your beliefs about yourself.\nI\n3\nHow to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple\nSteps\nN 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an\nexperiment that would lay the foundation for our understanding of\nhow habits form and the rules that guide our behavior. Thorndike was\ninterested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by\nworking with cats.\nHe would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The\nbox was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “by some\nsimple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or\nstepping on a platform.” For example, one box contained a lever that,\nwhen pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door\nhad been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.\nMost cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the\nbox. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws\nthrough openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of\nexploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door\nwould open, and they would escape.\nThorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In\nthe beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as\nsoon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of\nlearning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of\npressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to\nthe food.\nAfter twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and\nhabitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example,\nThorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act.\n160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20,\n12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”\nDuring the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5\nminutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3\nseconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions\nbecame quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the same\nmistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.\nFrom his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by\nstating, “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be\nrepeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less\nlikely to be repeated.” His work provides the perfect starting point for\ndiscussing how habits form in our own lives. It also provides answers\nto some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And why does\nthe brain bother building them at all?\nWHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become\nautomatic. The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.\nWhenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to\nmake a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come\nacross a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat,\nyou’re just trying things out to see what works.\nNeurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are\ncarefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about\nhow to act. You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to\nmake sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective\ncourse of action.\nOccasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a\nsolution. You’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run\ncalms you down. You’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work,\nand you learn that playing video games relaxes you. You’re exploring,\nexploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.\nAfter you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your\nstrategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the\nevents that preceded the reward. Wait a minute—that felt good. What\ndid I do right before that?\nThis is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn,\ntry differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and\nthe useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.\nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to\nautomate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of\nautomatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face\nregularly. As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are,\nsimply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”\nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases.\nYou learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out\neverything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know\nexactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every\nangle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and\ncreates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive scripts can be\nfollowed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate. Now,\nwhenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as you walk\nin the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choice\nthat once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created.\nHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a\nhabit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a\nproblem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw\non this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The\nprimary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what\nwill work in the future.\nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is\nthe bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at\na time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your\nconscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever\npossible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the\nnonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens\nwhen a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up\nmental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.\nDespite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits\nof habits. The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull? I\ndon’t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy. Doesn’t\nso much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?”\nHardly. Such questions set up a false dichotomy. They make you think\nthat you have to choose between building habits and attaining\nfreedom. In reality, the two complement each other.\nHabits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people\nwho don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least\namount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be\nstruggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will\nalways seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you\nwill always feel like you’re behind the curve. If you’re always being\nforced to make decisions about simple tasks—when should I work out,\nwhere do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have less time\nfor freedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that\nyou can create the mental space needed for free thinking and\ncreativity.\nConversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of\nlife are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges\nand master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present\nallows you to do more of what you want in the future.\nTHE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK\nThe process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps:\ncue, craving, response, and reward.* Breaking it down into these\nfundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it\nworks, and how to improve it.\nFIGURE 5: All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue,\ncraving, response, and reward.\nThis four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain\nruns through these steps in the same order each time.\nFirst, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a\nbehavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our\nprehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the\nlocation of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend\nmost of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like\nmoney and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and\nfriendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these\npursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction,\nwhich is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)\nYour mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external\nenvironment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is\nthe first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a\ncraving.\nCravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force\nbehind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—\nwithout craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is\nnot the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave\nsmoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are\nnot motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a\nclean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be\nentertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal\nstate. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.\nCravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of\ninformation could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not\nmotivated by the same cues. For a gambler, the sound of slot machines\ncan be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For\nsomeone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are\njust background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.\nThe thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what\ntransform a cue into a craving.\nThe third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you\nperform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a\nresponse occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much\nfriction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires\nmore physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you\nwon’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds\nsimple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you\nwant to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough to reach the\nhoop, well, you’re out of luck.\nFinally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of\nevery habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about\nwanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We\nchase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and\n(2) they teach us.\nThe first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards\nprovide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you\nneed to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect.\nGetting in shape improves your health and your dating prospects. But\nthe more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat\nor to gain status or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewards\ndeliver contentment and relief from craving.\nSecond, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in\nthe future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life,\nyour sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions\nsatisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and\ndisappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your\nbrain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the\nfeedback loop and complete the habit cycle.\nIf a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not\nbecome a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.\nReduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to\nact. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if\nthe reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do\nit again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not\noccur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.\nTHE HABIT LOOP\nFIGURE 6: The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop.\nThey form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This\n“habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will\nhappen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.*\nIn summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response,\nwhich provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately,\nbecomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a\nneurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue,\ncraving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create\nautomatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.\nThis four-step process is not something that happens occasionally,\nbut rather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active\nduring every moment you are alive—even now. The brain is continually\nscanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying\nout different responses, and learning from the results. The entire\nprocess is completed in a split second, and we use it again and again\nwithout realizing everything that has been packed into the previous\nmoment.\nWe can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase\nand the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the\ncraving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The\nsolution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when\nyou take action and achieve the change you desire.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\nSolution phase\n3. Response\n4. Reward\nAll behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes\nthe problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain\nit. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you\nwant to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the\nproblems you face.\nIn the table on the following page, you can see a few examples of\nwhat this looks like in real life.\nImagine walking into a dark room and flipping on the light switch.\nYou have performed this simple habit so many times that it occurs\nwithout thinking. You proceed through all four stages in the fraction of\na second. The urge to act strikes you without thinking.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: Your phone buzzes with a new text message.\n2. Craving: You want to learn the contents of the message.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You grab your phone and read the text.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes\nassociated with your phone buzzing.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You are answering emails.\n2. Craving: You begin to feel stressed and overwhelmed by work. You want to feel in control.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You bite your nails.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to reduce stress. Biting your nails becomes associated\nwith answering email.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You wake up.\n2. Craving: You want to feel alert.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You drink a cup of coffee.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to feel alert. Drinking coffee becomes associated with\nwaking up.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You smell a doughnut shop as you walk down the street near your office.\n2. Craving: You begin to crave a doughnut.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You buy a doughnut and eat it.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to eat a doughnut. Buying a doughnut becomes\nassociated with walking down the street near your office.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You hit a stumbling block on a project at work.\n2. Craving: You feel stuck and want to relieve your frustration.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You pull out your phone and check social media.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to feel relieved. Checking social media becomes\nassociated with feeling stalled at work.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue: You walk into a dark room.\n2. Craving: You want to be able to see.\nSolution phase\n3. Response: You flip the light switch.\n4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to see. Turning on the light switch becomes associated\nwith being in a dark room.\nBy the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are\nrunning our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the fact\nthat we tie the same shoe first each morning, or unplug the toaster\nafter each use, or always change into comfortable clothes after getting\nhome from work. After decades of mental programming, we\nautomatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.\nTHE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE\nIn the following chapters, we will see time and again how the four\nstages of cue, craving, response, and reward influence nearly\neverything we do each day. But before we do that, we need to\ntransform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use\nto design good habits and eliminate bad ones.\nI refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and\nit provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking\nbad ones. You can think of each law as a lever that influences human\nbehavior. When the levers are in the right positions, creating good\nhabits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly\nimpossible.\nHow to Create a Good Habit\nThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.\nThe 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.\nThe 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.\nThe 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.\nWe can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.\nHow to Break a Bad Habit\nInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.\nInversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.\nInversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.\nInversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.\nIt would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four laws are an\nexhaustive framework for changing any human behavior, but I think\nthey’re close. As you will soon see, the Four Laws of Behavior Change\napply to nearly every field, from sports to politics, art to medicine,\ncomedy to management. These laws can be used no matter what\nchallenge you are facing. There is no need for completely different\nstrategies for each habit.\nWhenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask\nyourself:\n1. How can I make it obvious?\n2. How can I make it attractive?\n3. How can I make it easy?\n4. How can I make it satisfying?\nIf you have ever wondered, “Why don’t I do what I say I’m going to\ndo? Why don’t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirement\nor start that side business? Why do I say something is important but\nnever seem to make time for it?” The answers to those questions can be\nfound somewhere in these four laws. The key to creating good habits\nand breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws and\nhow to alter them to your specifications. Every goal is doomed to fail if\nit goes against the grain of human nature.\nYour habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chapters\nthat follow, we will discuss these laws one by one and show how you\ncan use them to create a system in which good habits emerge naturally\nand bad habits wither away.\nChapter Summary\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to\nbecome automatic.\nThe ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with\nas little energy and effort as possible.\nAny habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves\nfour steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.\nThe Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we\ncan use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2)\nmake it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.\nTHE 1ST LAW\nMake It Obvious\n4\nThe Man Who Didn’t Look Right\nTHE PSYCHOLOGIST GARY Klein once told me a story about a woman who\nattended a family gathering. She had spent years working as a\nparamedic and, upon arriving at the event, took one look at her father-\nin-law and got very concerned.\n“I don’t like the way you look,” she said.\nHer father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied,\n“Well, I don’t like your looks, either.”\n“No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.”\nA few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery after\nan examination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery\nand was at immediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in-\nlaw’s intuition, he could have died.\nWhat did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending\nheart attack?\nWhen major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending\nblood to critical organs and away from peripheral locations near the\nsurface of the skin. The result is a change in the pattern of distribution\nof blood in the face. After many years of working with people with\nheart failure, the woman had unknowingly developed the ability to\nrecognize this pattern on sight. She couldn’t explain what it was that\nshe noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but she knew something was\nwrong.\nSimilar stories exist in other fields. For example, military analysts\ncan identify which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile and\nwhich one is a plane from their own fleet even though they are\ntraveling at the same speed, flying at the same altitude, and look\nidentical on radar in nearly every respect. During the Gulf War,\nLieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship when\nhe ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly\nlike the battleship’s own planes on radar. He made the right call, but\neven his superior officers couldn’t explain how he did it.\nMuseum curators have been known to discern the difference\nbetween an authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit\neven though they can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off.\nExperienced radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area\nwhere a stroke will develop before any obvious signs are visible to the\nuntrained eye. I’ve even heard of hairdressers noticing whether a client\nis pregnant based only on the feel of her hair.\nThe human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking\nin your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.\nWhenever you experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic\nseeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a\nmissile on a radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is\nimportant, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant\ncues, and cataloging that information for future use.\nWith enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict\ncertain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically,\nyour brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t\nalways explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all\nalong the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given\nsituation is the foundation for every habit you have.\nWe underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without\nthinking. You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your\nlungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles\nall this and more on autopilot. You are much more than your conscious\nself.\nConsider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t\nnecessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time\nto eat. Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body\nhas a variety of feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time\nto eat again and that track what is going on around you and within you.\nCravings can arise thanks to hormones and chemicals circulating\nthrough your body. Suddenly, you’re hungry even though you’re not\nquite sure what tipped you off.\nThis is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you\ndon’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an\nopportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to\nit. This is what makes habits useful.\nIt’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions\ncome under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind.\nYou fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless\nsomeone points it out, you may not notice that you cover your mouth\nwith your hand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking a\nquestion, or that you have a habit of finishing other people’s sentences.\nAnd the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you become to\nquestion what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.\nI once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty gift\ncards after customers had used up the balance on the card. One day,\nthe clerk cashed out a few customers in a row who purchased with gift\ncards. When the next person walked up, the clerk swiped the\ncustomer’s actual credit card, picked up the scissors, and then cut it in\nhalf—entirely on autopilot—before looking up at the stunned customer\nand realizing what had just happened.\nAnother woman I came across in my research was a former\npreschool teacher who had switched to a corporate job. Even though\nshe was now working with adults, her old habits would kick in and she\nkept asking coworkers if they had washed their hands after going to the\nbathroom. I also found the story of a man who had spent years\nworking as a lifeguard and would occasionally yell “Walk!” whenever\nhe saw a child running.\nOver time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that\nthey are essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the\nremote control next to the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our\nresponses to these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the\nurge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the\nprocess of behavior change with awareness.\nBefore we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle\non our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds\nbecause once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly\nnonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t\nexpect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you\nmake the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will\ncall it fate.”\nTHE HABITS SCORECARD\nThe Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the\nworld. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice\nthat the conductors have a peculiar habit.\nAs each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of\npointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train\napproaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is\ngreen.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will\npoint at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s time\nto leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out\non the platform, other employees are performing similar actions.\nBefore each train departs, staff members
